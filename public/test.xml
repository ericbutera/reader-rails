blog post or two…so I will start with a paper&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/mp/journal/vaop/ncurrent/pdf/mp20122a.pdf"&gt;available full text online&lt;/a&gt; (from a&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Nature&lt;/i&gt; offshoot&lt;i&gt;, Molecular Psychiatry&lt;/i&gt;) with the provocative theory of PATHOS-D. &amp;nbsp;It is really an amazing paper. &amp;nbsp;Go over and take a peek. &amp;nbsp;Absorb the diagrams. &amp;nbsp;It's a little dry, but way better than most of the nutrition literature.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Here is the theory. &amp;nbsp;Depression*, as we know, is associated with certain types of &lt;a href="http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/evolutionary-psychiatry/201103/depression-caused-inflammation-thus-other-diseases-civilization"&gt;inflammation in the brain&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;There are certain red immune system flags we see with the syndrome of depression quite frequently, most specifically increases in the cytokines TNF-alpha, IL-6, and C-reactive protein. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;These chemicals found in the blood and spinal fluid tell us a brigade of our immune system is on high alert, kicking a** and taking names, so to speak. &amp;nbsp;Problem is, when there are no invading a**es left to kick (or the invaders are too clever and elude our defenses), our brains get the full onslaught and neurons die and then you can't concentrate, and you avoid social activities, and you cry a lot, and eventually your primary care doctor gives up on your therapist and celexa and sends you to see someone like me.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;And we certainly know that genes in combination with stress &lt;a href="http://evolutionarypsychiatry.blogspot.com/2011/05/what-we-do-can-change-brain-trauma.html"&gt;will predispose us to depression&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;But some folks are bulletproof. &amp;nbsp;They won't get depressed in the most dire of circumstances. &amp;nbsp;Other people seem to be far more vulnerable. &amp;nbsp;All it takes is a bit of a mismatch between temperament of parent and child and we have major psychopathology. &amp;nbsp;A predisposition to depression is hereditary, therefore it must be encoded in our genes. &amp;nbsp;But what genes? &amp;nbsp;The PATHOS-D authors would suggest that the genes that predispose us to depression also protect us from infection.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Infection? &amp;nbsp;All of us humans in the brave new modern world have endured 10,000 years of agriculture, which brought with it dense population and massive infectious disease. Tuberculosis, for example, is said to have killed most humans who have ever lived. &amp;nbsp;The same genes that might give us a genetic advantage against infectious pathogens may lead to vulnerability to depression.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inflammation, like an army, is a double-edged sword. &amp;nbsp;People with trigger-happy immune systems are more likely to survive many infections (though a tricky beast like the 1919 flu killed the young adults with the most robust immune systems via massive pulmonary immune reactions and septic shock). &amp;nbsp;Since infections in the developing world tend to preferentially kill young children, there is strong selection pressure for genes that will save you when you are young, even if those genes have a cost later in life. &amp;nbsp;The selection pressure would have to be strong, as a clinical depression has obvious survival downsides, for both the person affected and his or her offspring. &amp;nbsp;Depression tends to be chronically recurring and also will strike folks in 20s and 30s, unlike, say, Alzheimer's or most cardiovascular disease, thus selection pressure against depression alleles would likely be significant…unless those same alleles protected against something even more deadly that often strikes even younger, like infectious disease. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cool theory, but where is the evidence? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, &lt;a href="http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/evolutionary-psychiatry/201112/nature-and-nurture"&gt;just as in schizophrenia&lt;/a&gt;, geneticists have tried to brute force hack the human genome in order to find a "depression gene." &amp;nbsp;And just like in schizophrenia, they haven't had a lot of success. &amp;nbsp;The answer (again, similar to schizophrenia and probably a lot of other diseases that don't fall into a simple single-gene model) will likely lie in looking at a group of genes for particular functions (say, immune function, or brain communication) and finding many different problems in those pathways in those who are genetically predisposed to depression. &amp;nbsp; In all the genome searching, a couple of genes have come up consistently involved with depression in certain predisposed families. &amp;nbsp;Both of them happen to be involved with cytokine signaling/immune function. &amp;nbsp;That would be a heck of a coincidence. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One allele, -308A, has found to be associated with increased risk of depression along with decreased risk of tuberculosis infection, parvovirus B19, hepatitis B, and a lower risk of death when hospitalized while critically ill. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What about other genes that have been found to be associated with depression risk but weren't found on large population genome-wide association studies? &amp;nbsp;We've discussed many of these genes and pathways in the history of this blog. MTHFR 677T is a version of methylenetetrahydrofolate&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: 10px;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;reductase with reduced activity. &amp;nbsp;That means the &lt;a href="http://evolutionarypsychiatry.blogspot.com/2011/08/folate-beginning.html"&gt;folate we eat in our diets will have a harder time being transformed into the folate that is active in the brain&lt;/a&gt; (methylfolate). &amp;nbsp;Since folate is necessary to make things such as neuroransmitters and DNA, a brain without folate is in a sad state. &amp;nbsp;Low MTHFR is associated with increases in homocysteine and overall inflammatory tone. &amp;nbsp;Since low folate is also associated with devastating birth defects, one would think there would be pretty strong selection pressure against this gene, but it is actually fairly common in the population. &amp;nbsp;Why? &amp;nbsp;Well, the inefficient version of MTHFR is found to be protective against cytomegalovirus infection, sexually transmitted disease, and hepatitis B. &amp;nbsp;In places where there is sufficient folate in the food, MTHFR inefficiencies may not be devastating and could mean protection against infections that cause other devastating birth defects and disease. &amp;nbsp;In sub-Saharan Africa there is low folate availability, and the MTHFR 677T allele is nearly absent there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ApoE is another molecule we've discussed at some length. &amp;nbsp;It is a signaling molecule located on the surface of lipoproteins (which carry around fats and cholesterol and vitamins, like LDL). &amp;nbsp;ApoE4 is the original, ancestral allele, and those who carry it have a higher risk for both Alzheimer's disease and depression. &amp;nbsp;E4 is associated with increased inflammation in general. &amp;nbsp;E2 is a protective version and means decreased risk of major depressive disorder and Alzheimer's compared to E4. &amp;nbsp;The E4 allele may be protective against childhood diarrheal illnesses, while those with E2 seem to be more vulnerable to tuberculosis and malaria.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most studied (and debated) alleles associated with depression are so-called short and long form of the 5HTTLPR. &amp;nbsp;This gene is a promotor region that tells the cell to make a serotonin transporter. &amp;nbsp;Those with the short allele (particularly with two short alleles) seem to have a &lt;a href="http://evolutionarypsychiatry.blogspot.com/2011/05/what-we-do-can-change-brain-trauma.html"&gt;much higher risk of developing major depression&lt;/a&gt; when exposed to early childhood trauma, whereas the long form of the gene is protective. &amp;nbsp;However, the short gene isn't all bad. &amp;nbsp;Those who have it seem to have a lower risk of dying from sudden infant death syndrome, and the gene is associated with higher circulating cytokines in response to stress, which could protect you if the stress is from being wounded or an infection. &amp;nbsp;In populations where the short gene is more common, there also tends to be more exposure to epidemic infections, suggesting selection pressure for the short gene. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, there is some thought put into the clinical syndrome of depression and how it might protect you and your offspring if you do have an acute infection. &amp;nbsp;It is well known that inflammatory mediators (such as IL-6 or interferon) induce depression symptoms on their own. &amp;nbsp;If you have come down with an infectious disease, being depressed would keep you isolated and conserve energy, reduce appetite (maybe to induce ketosis to improve viral and bacterial immunity?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the strength of an evolutionary/ancestral paradigm for studying disease helps to provide a sensible framework, like the PATHOS-D theory. &amp;nbsp;Clinically, it helps us to focus on the immune system and inflammation, and how that may have been altered by modern diet, stress, lack of &lt;a href="http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/evolutionary-psychiatry/201105/the-parasite-ate-your-depression"&gt;parasites and pseudocommensals&lt;/a&gt;, changed sleep, infectious burden, and physical activity. &amp;nbsp; Forget the random crapshoot of mere brute force epidemiology. &amp;nbsp;There are too many confounders, and it will lead us in the wrong direction as often as not. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;*here we are using the clinical definition of depression. &amp;nbsp;Not just a sad mood for reason, such as grief. &amp;nbsp;Usually we are talking about a sad mood with inability to enjoy things we used to enjoy, poor concentration, poor or unrestorative sleep, appetite change (classically poor appetite), guilt, self-doubt, and even suicidal thoughts. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3045634714760830992-6979089677843367200?l=evolutionarypsychiatry.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>http://evolutionarypsychiatry.blogspot.com/2012/03/depression-genetic-faustian-bargain.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Emily Deans)</author><thr:total>4</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3045634714760830992.post-2220477922669090313</guid><pubDate>Sun, 04 Mar 2012 23:31:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2012-03-04T18:31:13.788-05:00</atom:updated><title>Reviews of Escape the Diet Trap, Eat Like a Dinosaur, and Well Fed</title><description>One of the perks of having a relatively well-read blog (here and on &lt;a href="http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/evolutionary-psychiatry"&gt;Psychology Today&lt;/a&gt;) is getting free copies of recent books that come out. &amp;nbsp;Some of them are from the Psychology Today bloggers, others from the paleosphere. &amp;nbsp;I also purchase Evolutionary Psychiatry-related books, mostly textbooks, and nowadays I can use my blog income and donations to do so, so I've about broken even with my endeavors. &amp;nbsp;The hard part comes with getting time to read these books. &amp;nbsp;It's a lot easier to make time for a 5-6 page paper or even a handful of them than to sit down and give a book the attention it deserves. &amp;nbsp;Even harder to write a detailed review. &amp;nbsp;Synopses were always my achilles heel when it came to selling my writing in the past.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;First off, &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Escape-Diet-Trap-Paperback-Briffa/dp/0007442432"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Escape the Diet Trap&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/a&gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.drbriffa.com/"&gt;Dr. John Briffa&lt;/a&gt; is a physician in private practice in London, &lt;a href="http://link.brightcove.com/services/player/bcpid69900095001?bckey=AQ~~,AAAAAEabvr4~,Wtd2HT-p_VhJQ6tgdykx3j23oh1YN-2U&amp;amp;bctid=755094138001"&gt;seen here&lt;/a&gt; cleaning the floor with a statin apologist on television. &amp;nbsp; Dr. Briffa was kind enough to send me a copy of his book, and he mentions my blog under the "resources" section, &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; he signed it for me. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;In general there is a lot to like about this book, and it begins with a nice understandable rebuttal of the diet-heart hypothesis with an evolutionary medicine-reasoned slant. &amp;nbsp;The recommended diet is low-carb paleo with lots of behavioral tips and techniques. &amp;nbsp;In addition, he recommends walking, high intensity intervals, and strength training (even giving a little routine) matched to one's basic fitness level. &amp;nbsp;It's a very reasonable, researched work that does not make any outlandish claims, and is bound to work for most people, particularly at the beginning of their fat-loss journeys. &amp;nbsp;There are easy charts that tell you what to eat and sample menus, along with testimonials. &amp;nbsp;He also introduces the concept of intermittent fasting, which is a neat diet trick and very effective for some.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The book is definitely geared toward the insulin resistant and does plug the carbohydrate-insulin hypothesis for fat gain, which is my only quibble with it. &amp;nbsp;However, I think low carb is a great starting point for most people who aren't athletes or bodybuilders who have some weight to lose, for other reasons than the carbohydrate-insulin hypothesis. &amp;nbsp;Going low carb (and adding the paleo restrictions) will automatically eliminate a lot of foods that are low in nutrients and high in calories. &amp;nbsp;It will also keep one out of trouble with snack foods, engineered foods (as in everything you can buy to eat at a gas station), and restaurant foods. &amp;nbsp; It will get you used to cooking and used to eating a bit more healthy fat. &amp;nbsp;I don't think super low carb is great for everyone, particularly athletes or anyone doing a lot of glycolytic work, and I don't think low carb is the end all be all, the only way to longevity, or the only optimal human diet. &amp;nbsp;I don't think glucose is poison and I'm not afraid of insulin myself. &amp;nbsp; Dr. Briffa mentions that athletes will do better with more carbs, and says "part of the problem, though, is that many of us eat like marathon runners but spend practically all our time sitting on our bums." (p. 236) &amp;nbsp;Most recreational exercisers will do fine on a moderately low carb diet, and I have no quibble with this fact.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Dr. Briffa stresses that his recommendations are not a "diet" (in fact the front cover says "this is not a diet book" in addition to the title of "Escape the Diet Trap"), and I like that focus as a lifestyle change, as the evidence is clear that you really can't ever return to your previous way of eating if it got you fat in the first place. &amp;nbsp;(I would think that is obvious, but &lt;a href="http://www.ritualcleanse.com/"&gt;$80 a day juice cleanses&lt;/a&gt; and cabbage diets are always plugged in the mass media, for sure). &amp;nbsp;He also stresses that we shouldn't consciously restrict calories (again, diets that force you to starve yourself by merely cutting calories will always fail, long term). &amp;nbsp;Portion control (using, for example, the palm of your hand as a measure for protein needs in a meal, as I've seen recommended ) and intermittent fasting are ways of backing into calorie counting without going nuts, and I'm always surprised (when I'm not cheating at all) how much volume of real food it actually takes to keep me running at full steam.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;My only disagreement with the book, really, is his inclusion of white potatoes (and presumably other starchy tubers, such as cassava) in the "foods to avoid" list and the restrictions on fruit if we are considering this book a diet for the rest of one's life. &amp;nbsp;It's pretty clear that unless you cross the line of 50 grams of fructose daily (&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Food-Western-Disease-evolutionary-perspective/dp/1405197714/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1330897126&amp;amp;sr=8-1"&gt;Staffan Lindeberg&lt;/a&gt; kept quoting the figure of 5 pineapples, which seems like nearly a physically impossible amount of sweet fruit for a non-fruitarian), your liver is well able to handle the amount in most fruit. &amp;nbsp;Going nutty with the dried fruit and fruit juice is a different story. &amp;nbsp;I think folks who have sugar-related emotional eating might to better getting rid of fruit for a time, or maybe forever, but for most it is a healthy part of the diet. &amp;nbsp;And while I object to restaurant french fries and potato chips, I simply don't see anything wrong with eating cooked potatoes (or other starchy root vegetables) as a general rule, and I think for those worried about the sustainability of the paleo diet with such a huge world population, the inclusion of potatoes will go a long way to feeding a lot of people with limited resources.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;In short, I would recommend this book to anyone wanting to lose weight (especially those with a lot of weight to lose) or as a gentle introduction to a paleo-style diet (or ideally both!). &amp;nbsp;Like most paleo books, people will need a bit of education after the fact to get them away from the idea of low carb as the only option.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Second up is the brand spanking new &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Eat-Like-Dinosaur-Guidebook-Gluten-free/dp/1936608871"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Eat Like a Dinosaur&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from the&lt;a href="http://paleoparents.com/eat-like-a-dinosaur/"&gt; Paleo Parents&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;Between them, Matt and Stacy have &lt;a href="http://paleoparents.com/our-before-after-story/"&gt;lost over 200 pounds&lt;/a&gt; and cured their children of many behavioral, skin, and hypersensitivity issues by switching to a paleo-style diet. &amp;nbsp;They sent me two copies of their book, and I am going to give one to a colleague with three small children. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;Eat Like a Dinosaur&lt;/i&gt; is a dairy-free, grain-free cookbook with a bit about the family, followed by a cute little children's story to help the kids understand the new way of eating, and then about a zillion recipes geared for families and a major influence on getting the kids involved with obtaining food, cooking, eating, which is great. &amp;nbsp;The recipes are mostly low carb, and use low carb flour substitutes such as almond and coconut flour. &amp;nbsp;Sweet potatoes are included, along with some desserts and sweets (using natural sugars such as maple syrup, honey, and palm sugar).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I think this book is a fabulous resource for families who have strict dietary needs, such as kids with celiac or hypersensitivities. &amp;nbsp;There are more than 150 recipes and lots of tips and tricks for snacks, making school lunches, and how to make meals fun for everyone. &amp;nbsp;The pictures aren't fantastic and there are a few typos, but those are small complaints. &amp;nbsp;I'm also wary of any recipe with coconut flour as a major ingredient (having made some horrible pancakes and muffins with it) and would probably modify some to include organic white rice flour myself, but as I rarely bake, I don't know that I will be experimenting with these anytime soon. &amp;nbsp;I know the kids would love some of the cupcake options, the icing, the smoothies, the fruit and nut bars, and other tasty treats. &amp;nbsp;There are also many, many recipes incorporating organ meats, dark green leafy vegetables, brussels sprouts, and other "adult" foods. All the low carb staple substitutes are there as well, including cauliflower rice, mashed cauliflower, almond flour pie crust, low carb cookies, etc.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;My husband and I have more of a European philosophy that children should eat pretty much what adults are eating, and we really shouldn't go out of our way too much to make special foods so they will eat them. &amp;nbsp;I don't have a lot of time to make cutesy food (and I don't have four different kinds of low carb gluten-free flour on hand), but then my kids aren't really all that picky. &amp;nbsp;They care more about the plate than the food, though given the opportunity they will of course complain about most everything healthy and beg for goldfish crackers or ice cream. &amp;nbsp;However, given the popularity of books like &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Deceptively-Delicious-Simple-Secrets-Eating/dp/006176793X"&gt;Deceptively Delicious&lt;/a&gt;, there must be a lot of families out there who are desperate to find ways to surreptitiously stuff their kids with vegetables and real food. &amp;nbsp;Now I have a hard time believing that Jessica Seinfeld herself purees vegetables for an hour or two every weekend for her children, I know some parents do. &amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Eat Like a Dinosaur&lt;/i&gt; has lots of simple ways to make good food cute (like putting tuna salad in a carved out cucumber boat), and if I had the time, necessity, or motivation, I would likely utilize them. &amp;nbsp;I'm likely to dive into this book for recipes for chicken nuggets, and cakes and cookies for birthday parties, pot-lucks, and family get togethers.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Given the unmitigated garbage that is marketed and fed to kids on a daily basis (I challenge any real food-loving or paleo parent to go to any snack time in any school and not be a bit horrified by the petroleum food dye blue low fat yogurt and ubiquitous fruit juice boxes and rainbow goldfish that pass as healthy food these days) and the&lt;a href="http://www.choosemyplate.gov/downloads/PatternA1200cals.pdf"&gt; frankly bizzare public health message&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;that stresses a low fat, low meat diet and high amounts of grains for kids who have such a need for lots of very nutrient-dense brain and growth foods, I certainly applaud very wholesome real food and healthy fat message of &lt;i&gt;Eat Like a Dinosaur&lt;/i&gt;. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I think growing, energetic kids do fine (or even better) with plenty of starchy carbs (and I do give my kids organic white rice, usually cooked in homemade stock with grassfed butter, dulse flakes, &amp;nbsp;or coconut milk and a cinnamon stick) in part to hide some of the fat in their lunch (schools are obligated to encourage you to feed low-fat, which is of course ridiculous). &amp;nbsp;My kids seem to do fine with dairy, also, and they get full fat organic milk and yogurt. &amp;nbsp;I might try to wean the older one (who is 4&amp;amp;1/2) off so much milk, but she seems to be doing that naturally as she ages.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;In short, &lt;i&gt;Eat Like a Dinosaur &lt;/i&gt;is perfect for kids and families who want to be strict paleo (with a ton of &amp;nbsp;baking and substitution options) and is great for getting kids who have allergies on board with the restrictions of a paleo diet.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The last book on my list is one I bought myself (though I bought it in part because the gorgeous Melissa and Dallas Hartwig gave me their &lt;a href="http://whole9life.com/2012/01/whole-30-v2012/"&gt;Whole30 Success Guide&lt;/a&gt; last summer, which I thought was terrific). &amp;nbsp;Melissa Joulwan of &lt;a href="http://www.theclothesmakethegirl.com/"&gt;The Clothes Make the Girl&lt;/a&gt; has written by far my favorite paleo cookbook, &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Well-Fed-Paleo-Recipes-People/dp/061557226X"&gt;Well Fed&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;(paleo recipes for people who love to eat). &amp;nbsp;Most of the recipes are Whole30 compliant, and every one I have tried is very tasty. &amp;nbsp;I love Well Fed because there is a big section on shopping, supplies, and making "hot plates" for ideas for eating good (mostly simple) food all the time with minimal prep (for "real food"). &amp;nbsp;There are also plenty of recipes for those nights when you want to spend some time making a special meal. &amp;nbsp;So far I've made the chocolate chili, the moroccan meatballs, the meatza, and the "best" chicken and they were all terrific. &amp;nbsp;Honestly it is the best practical cookbook for eating clean (though &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Primal-Blueprint-Quick-Easy-Meals/dp/0982207743"&gt;Mark Sisson's Primal Blueprint Quick and Easy Meals&lt;/a&gt; is a close second). &amp;nbsp;You aren't going to find as many sweet crowd pleasers for adult parties, but &lt;a href="http://paleocomfortfoods.com/"&gt;Paleo Comfort Foods&lt;/a&gt; has those. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I love the Whole30 and &lt;i&gt;Well Fed&lt;/i&gt; because I think they start where&lt;i&gt; Escape the Diet Trap&lt;/i&gt; leaves off, with super dialed in nutrition to give you a clean starting point to see what foods you tolerate and which ones you don't. &amp;nbsp;For the most part they also meet my personal food philosophy, which is mostly simple and easy with portion control, and some special dishes. &amp;nbsp;I "cheat" more than they recommend (with chocolate, some gluten and processed foods, white potatoes, white rice, and alcohol), but when I have the Whole30 dialed in, I get lean, lean, lean. &amp;nbsp;As long as I avoid dairy, I can cheat with some impunity and I don't tend to gain, but I didn't figure that out until after I did the Whole30. &amp;nbsp;I do like the idea of purely nutrient-rich food and sugar avoidance as a starting point to clear the decks. &amp;nbsp;However, personally I don't see anything terribly wrong with a bit of white potato or white rice, particularly if you beef up the nutrition of the rice in the cooking. &amp;nbsp;(Unpolished, unfortified white rice killed the Japanese in droves with &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beriberi"&gt;beri-beri&lt;/a&gt; back in the day, so no one can argue it is a super food, and if it is grown in the US it has some arsenic).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Speaking of my personal nutrition and exercise philosophy, for exercise I do &lt;a href="http://crossfit.com/"&gt;Crossfit&lt;/a&gt;, which is somewhat controversial but works very well for me. &amp;nbsp;I have a lot of experience with weightlifting (even took a class in college), and the head trainer at my box is very experienced training beginners and athletes and has a healthy philosophy, avoiding the "&lt;a href="http://whole9life.com/2009/12/beware-the-lure-of-the-sexy-met-con/"&gt;sexy met-con&lt;/a&gt;" for the most part in exchange for lots of basic strength training and "short and sweet" WODs. &amp;nbsp;"Let's keep the cortisol under control." &amp;nbsp;He doesn't restrict the &lt;a href="http://whole9life.com/2010/09/i-heart-my-supraspinatus/"&gt;sumo deadlift high-pull&lt;/a&gt; which worries my friends &lt;a href="http://thatpaleoguy.com/"&gt;Jamie Scott &lt;/a&gt;and Dallas Hartwig. &amp;nbsp;And I do have a fritzy shoulder (pre-dating Crossfit by about 18 years) so I do consciously (for the most part) take care not to push it too hard. &amp;nbsp;I think Crossfit is a great option for the experienced exerciser who has limited time and likes the motivation of an involved and enthusiastic community. &amp;nbsp;My six am box-mates will send me a facebook message if I'm not there when expected, I get a lot of personalized attention on technique and the like, and you can't really say the same thing about a normal globo-gym if you don't pay for a personal trainer. &amp;nbsp;I wouldn't go to just any Crossfit with just any trainer, however, without some experience and wisdom about your own limits.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;In the future I will do a few more book reviews. &amp;nbsp;I'll do an Evolutionary Psychology triple-header and other reviews of &lt;a href="http://howtobesick.com/"&gt;How to Be Sick&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Harnessed-Language-Mimicked-Nature-Transformed/dp/1935618539"&gt;Harnessed&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;In the mean time there are a bunch of new nutrition and mental health papers to look at, and some other larger topics to explore. &amp;nbsp;I'm also heading into another season of talks, conventions, and podcasts, so the timing for these endeavors is rather unpredictable.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3045634714760830992-2220477922669090313?l=evolutionarypsychiatry.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>http://evolutionarypsychiatry.blogspot.com/2012/03/reviews-of-escape-diet-trap-eat-like.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Emily Deans)</author><thr:total>4</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3045634714760830992.post-1772305011372818899</guid><pubDate>Sat, 03 Mar 2012 20:32:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2012-03-03T15:32:59.725-05:00</atom:updated><title>Brain Aging and Omega 3</title><description>Framingham, Massachusetts, founded in 1700, is a manufacturing area somewhat to the north of where I live. &amp;nbsp;Most folks interested in the medical sciences have heard of Framingham because it houses the subjects of one of the longest-running and famous studies of all time, the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framingham_Heart_Study"&gt;Framingham Heart Study&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;Begun in 1948, scientists have followed several generations of residents assessing diet, heart health, and other markers of disease.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;In &lt;a href="http://www.neurology.org/content/78/9/658.abstract"&gt;this new paper,&lt;/a&gt; the second Framingham study generation (average age 67) was observed for a relationship between red blood cell omega 3 (specifically DHA) levels, scores on cognitive testing, and MRIs. &amp;nbsp;It's a snapshot, just some interesting info, but let's see what we find.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Many studies measure levels of omega 3 in the body. &amp;nbsp;Plasma levels (from the blood) reflect dietary intake over a few days. &amp;nbsp;Red blood cells live about 120 days, so RBC membranes have omega 3 levels that correlate to dietary intake over the same amount of time. &amp;nbsp;These levels also correlate with fatty acid concentrations in other tissues, like the heart. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;First off, the MRIs. &amp;nbsp;The images were studied to look for measures of brain aging, such as lower brain volume, hippocampal volume, and white matter hyperintensity volume. &amp;nbsp; Gray matter is the cell bodies, white matter is the wiring (more or less), and "white matter hyperintensity" can indicate scarring or other damage. &amp;nbsp;The Framingham participants in the lowest quartile of RBC DHA amount had the oldest-looking brains, with lower total volumes and more white matter hyperintensity. &amp;nbsp;Once you got past the lowest quartile, however, there was no further relationship between the DHA levels and these brain findings. &amp;nbsp;So it appears there is a threshold where you need enough omega 3, and beyond that more omega 3 is not helpful (if we assume causation, that lower dietary omega 3 will cause problems and higher is protective).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The cognitive testing was fairly basic, but given over 1500 participants in the study, that is not surprising. &amp;nbsp;Delayed verbal memory, visuospatial memory, similarities testing, and a &lt;a href="http://www.granddriver.net/data/media/docs/UIowa_trailMaking.pdf"&gt;trails test &lt;/a&gt;were done. &amp;nbsp;In general these tests can give a rough picture of how good your memory, reasoning, attention, and &lt;a href="http://www.help4adhd.org/faq.cfm?fid=40&amp;amp;varLang=en"&gt;executive functioning&lt;/a&gt; are. &amp;nbsp;RBC DHA levels were continuously and positively associated with 3 of the 4 tests (only verbal memory had no association). &amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;We know from other observational studies that regular fish consumption is (for the most part) associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular disease and dementia. &amp;nbsp;It seems that the ability to make DHA and EPA from the shorter ALA decreases as we age, so the older we are, the more important it is to get long chain omega 3s in the diet. &amp;nbsp;As I have reviewed in past blog posts, controlled trials supplementing with DHA, EPA, or both seem to have &lt;a href="http://evolutionarypsychiatry.blogspot.com/2010/11/omega-3-not-cure-for-alzheimer-again.html"&gt;no effect in advanced dementia&lt;/a&gt;, but do seem to have a positive effect in mild cognitive impairment (a very early form of dementia that can progress further) and very mild Alzheimer's dementia.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Alzheimer's dementia and vascular dementia (dementia caused by the cumulative damage of strokes) are the most common forms of dementia, and having sufficient long chain omega 3s could protect us from both. &amp;nbsp;DHA and EPA seem to lower blood pressure, vascular inflammation, and reduce blood clotting. &amp;nbsp;These long chain omega 3s are also vital constituents of the "lipid rafts" and therefore cell membrane function. &amp;nbsp;As I've reviewed in the past, good levels of DHA in the brain seem to &lt;a href="http://evolutionarypsychiatry.blogspot.com/2010/09/alzheimer-and-omega-3s.html"&gt;reduce neuroinflammation and the creation of amyloid beta plaques &lt;/a&gt;(associated with Alzheimer's).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Since long chain omega 3 fatty acids duke it out with the omega 6s for a spot on the plasma membrane of cells, it seems plausible that you don't need to eat fish three times a week if you keep your omega 6 intake low. &amp;nbsp;If you listen to &lt;a href="http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/faculty/walter-willett/"&gt;this guy,&lt;/a&gt; your omega 6 intake will be high. &amp;nbsp;If you avoid processed foods, peanut and seed oils, and large quantities of most nuts and poultry and conventional eggs and lard… well, omega 6 will be less. &amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/evolutionary-psychiatry/201103/your-brain-omega-3"&gt;Your brain can tell the difference&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3045634714760830992-1772305011372818899?l=evolutionarypsychiatry.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>http://evolutionarypsychiatry.blogspot.com/2012/03/brain-aging-and-omega-3.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Emily Deans)</author><thr:total>2</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3045634714760830992.post-8756302401371495074</guid><pubDate>Tue, 28 Feb 2012 15:26:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2012-02-28T10:26:19.301-05:00</atom:updated><title>Zinc Deficiency and Children with Autism</title><description>Thanks to &lt;a href="http://evolutionarypsychiatry.blogspot.com/2012/01/autism-and-antioxidants-wee-little.html?showComment=1330367134974#c5889650727269071613"&gt;a commenter &lt;/a&gt;for pointing me to a newish study (open access): &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/srep/2011/111103/srep00129/full/srep00129.html"&gt;&amp;nbsp;Infantile zinc deficiency: Association with autism spectrum disorders&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see Paul Whiteley already covered it &lt;a href="http://questioning-answers.blogspot.com/2011/11/link-with-zinc.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;If you are interested in the autism spectrum disorders, I very highly recommend his blog. &amp;nbsp;Paul is very sober and clear-sighted about the limitations of the research information but has an open mind about what might be clues to the pathophysiology of these disorders. &amp;nbsp;Since it is a long paper, and Paul and I have quite different styles, I think there is plenty of room for my own thoughts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Atlas Genius: &amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGmCjVbC1CY"&gt;Trojans&lt;/a&gt; (right click to open in new tab)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this study, nearly 2000 children with autistic disorders had hair tested for zinc deficiency. &amp;nbsp;584 (29.6%) subjects had levels lower than two &lt;a href="http://www.robertniles.com/stats/stdev.shtml"&gt;standard deviations&lt;/a&gt; below the mean of the reference range. &amp;nbsp;43.5% of the male children ages 0-3 and 52.5% of the female children 0-3 in the sample were zinc deficient. &amp;nbsp;Older children with autism in the study had a lower incidence of zinc deficiency, which continued to decrease with the age of the subject sample, to the point where autistic children over the age of 10 had normal zinc levels. &amp;nbsp;Normal hair zinc in healthy children appears to be around 130 ppm, and one autistic 2 year old in the study had a level of 10.7 ppm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However you slice it (and let's take into account the limitations of a strictly observational study), that is an impressive finding. &amp;nbsp;The authors speculate that epigenetics could be a factor in the pathophysiology of autism. &amp;nbsp;Epigenetics is the alteration of gene expression by environmental influences. &amp;nbsp;Mineral deficiencies could certainly alter gene expression and perhaps cause an epigenetic disorder. &amp;nbsp;The other side of the argument is that active inflammation and stress causes us to &lt;a href="http://evolutionarypsychiatry.blogspot.com/2010/07/zinc-and-depression.html"&gt;waste zinc&lt;/a&gt; (and other minerals) as part of the inflammatory process. &amp;nbsp;Since we know &lt;a href="http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/evolutionary-psychiatry/201104/autism-inflammation-speculation-and-nutrition"&gt;autistic spectrum disorders are related to inflammation&lt;/a&gt;, it would make perfect sense that babies and toddlers with autism would have low zinc levels. &amp;nbsp;Low serum zinc also seems to be associated with heavy metal toxicity, which is also associated with autistic spectrum disorders (more often cadmium and aluminum, according to the study authors, than mercury).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But measuring a mineral deficiency is more tricky than it might appear. &amp;nbsp;Zinc can be sequestered in the bones or liver and bound up by protein in the serum. &amp;nbsp;Zinc levels can vary considerably based on infection, stress, low protein levels in the blood, and even time of day. &amp;nbsp;Hair levels could perhaps be considered a more reliable indicator of full-body zinc stores, so may be a more useful measure for these sorts of studies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zinc deficiency could very plausibly be part of what causes the symptoms of autism. &amp;nbsp;Zinc plays an important role in protein synthesis, cell growth and repair, and levels need to be super topped off in pregnant women and infants where all these processes are occurring at a more rapid rate than any other time in one's life. &amp;nbsp;Also, we know that &lt;a href="http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/evolutionary-psychiatry/201104/diet-and-autism"&gt;a "leaky gut" has been associated with autism&lt;/a&gt; in a rather well-designed study, and with leaky guts there is malabsorption of nutrients and minerals. &amp;nbsp;Many children with autism have signs from birth (when everyone has a leaky gut, up through 6 months of age when there is no argument that exclusive breastmilk is best, period), but some children seem to develop normally and do not exhibit symptoms until later. &amp;nbsp;Could leaky guts leading to toxin exposure, and micronutrient deficiency have something to do with these cases? &amp;nbsp;Seems a plausible theory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, in the setting of zinc deficiency, the intestinal zinc importer (the awesomely named Zip4) is upregulated, sensibly enough. &amp;nbsp; Increasing Zip4 can increase the absorption of toxic heavy metals such as cadmium and lead. &amp;nbsp;Therefore an early zinc deficiency could plausibly lead to more absorption of toxic metals. &amp;nbsp; (Creepy fact from the article: &amp;nbsp;soy-based infant formulas have 6 times higher cadmium levels than cow's milk formulas, and cereal-based formulas 4-21 times higher levels (&lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10789373"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;).)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don't think there is any argument that we all need sufficient zinc, particularly pregnant women and babies. &amp;nbsp;As far as I know, there are no controlled studies of zinc supplementation in pregnant women and babies and autism risk, so we really can't make any conclusion or recommend any sort of increased zinc supplementation in babies at this point. &amp;nbsp;There is more data in ADHD and I should probably pull those papers myself (some of them are too old to pull easily) and do a post on it. &amp;nbsp;Super-high zinc intake has killed older people who used zinc-based denture cream by causing copper deficiency and heart arrhythmia, and babies and little children (like the elderly) will be more vulnerable to these sorts of insults.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More data please! &amp;nbsp;Researchers, rescue us from the rocky shoals of the unknown. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Hmmm. &amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.blairex.com/BLButtPaste.php"&gt;My favorite diaper cream is zinc-based&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;I wonder how much is absorbed and if that has any bearing on zinc levels, zinc deficiency, etc.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3045634714760830992-8756302401371495074?l=evolutionarypsychiatry.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>http://evolutionarypsychiatry.blogspot.com/2012/02/zinc-deficiency-and-children-with.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Emily Deans)</author><thr:total>5</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3045634714760830992.post-8599909143129219277</guid><pubDate>Sun, 26 Feb 2012 16:54:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2012-02-26T22:11:19.913-05:00</atom:updated><title>Thyrotropin Day to Night</title><description>It's a chilly Sunday morning. &amp;nbsp;More plowing away at the endocrine system, and now I remember why endocrinologists can be cranky sometimes. &amp;nbsp;Gads it is complicated, but beautiful. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two music selections, one for those who prefer a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caffeine"&gt;xanthine alkaloid&lt;/a&gt;

These carbohydrate molecules help with the creation and proper folding of the protein into its final active shape. &amp;nbsp;TSH is then a group of "isohormones" with different carbohydrate compositions. &amp;nbsp;People with hypothyroidism have an increase in &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sialic_acid"&gt;sialylated&lt;/a&gt; TSH which decreases when the hypothyroidism is treated with T4 hormone. (Sialylate is one type of &amp;nbsp;carbohydrate molecule that can be plopped onto TSH. &amp;nbsp;Sulfated carbohydrate is another). &amp;nbsp;Higher sialylation is also seen in the nocturnal surge of TSH in normal patients compared with the daytime circulating TSH in the same person. &amp;nbsp;In mice, as the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis develops and matures, there are higher proportions and more complex carbohydrate molecules on the TSH backbone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Phew. &amp;nbsp;Cowboy Junkies: &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vh70d7cIHHc"&gt;&amp;nbsp;I'm So Open&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What are all these carbohydrates doing? &amp;nbsp;Besides helping out with the folding and secretion of the protein, they also seem to modify the biologic activity of TSH. &amp;nbsp;If we take TSH and apply enzymes to it to clean off the carbohydrate molecules, TSH will still bind to its receptor, but its activity is very much reduced. &amp;nbsp;Increased sialylation seems to moderately reduce the activity of TSH at the receptor as well, at least in the test tube. &amp;nbsp;In the body, the highly sialylated TSH lasts longer than the less sialylated versions, so overall the sialylated form will cause &lt;i&gt;more&lt;/i&gt; receptor activation (though it is less potent, it lasts longer). &amp;nbsp;High-mannose versions of TSH seem to be more aggressive about stimulating messaging through the cell after alighting upon the TSH receptor and activating it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know. &amp;nbsp;See how one can be led down the garden path with respect to understanding something about hormonal regulation, but then you find a whole 'nother layer of complexity that boggles the mind. &amp;nbsp;Sialylation to sulfation ratios of circulating TSH affect metabolic activity and clearance, but these activities are also dependent upon the location on the TSH where the carbohydrate molecules are added (they can be added at all sorts of different places on the various protein subunits and frequently are). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These hormonal systems have developed over thousands of millennia of evolution, and it is only in the very recent past that we have understood much of any of it. &amp;nbsp;The spectacular dance of molecules and the exquisite microregulation is humbling, to say the least. &amp;nbsp;How much is changed by nighttime lighting, by inflammatory signals, by activity and rest? &amp;nbsp;Appreciation of the complexity is what makes me try, in a practical fashion, to emulate the diet and lifestyle of the paleolithic past, as it seems likely the best way to keep the system acting at optimal capacity. &amp;nbsp;That's just a hunch, but I think the null hypothesis that begs to be disproven.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3045634714760830992-8599909143129219277?l=evolutionarypsychiatry.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>http://evolutionarypsychiatry.blogspot.com/2012/02/thyrotropin-day-to-night.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Emily Deans)</author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-MYG-W_UoleE/T0pLx61nORI/AAAAAAAAASg/B89TjO0gIcU/s72-c/IMG_2408.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>3</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3045634714760830992.post-31412542253545816</guid><pubDate>Thu, 23 Feb 2012 20:47:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2012-02-23T17:53:30.676-05:00</atom:updated><title>Meatless = Less Tense in the Short Term</title><description>Hi! &amp;nbsp;Back to the thyroid in a bit… but I've had a few questions about a study that came out earlier this week so I thought I would do a quick post.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nutritionj.com/content/pdf/1475-2891-11-9.pdf"&gt;Restriction of meat, fish, and poultry omnivores improves mood: a randomized controlled trial&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPAVDHo1Elc"&gt;The Strokes: 12:51&lt;/a&gt; (video starts with an ad. &amp;nbsp;Sorry!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This pilot study was small and interesting and embarked upon to try to answer some questions about diet and mood. &amp;nbsp;Hooray! Specifically the authors speculate that the arachidonic acid (AA) in meat could impact how we feel, and that restricting AA could make us feel better. &amp;nbsp; AA (which is a highly unsaturated omega 6 fatty acid) is situated in the biochemistry to be pro-inflammatory (though WAPF has &lt;a href="http://www.cholesterol-and-health.com/Foods-High-In-Cholesterol.html"&gt;some issues with this characterization&lt;/a&gt;). &amp;nbsp;Specifically, AA eaten directly competes with the desaturating enzymes for EPA (a long chain omega 3 fish oil constituent), so AA could potentially increase pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNFalpha which are known to have mood altering effects. &amp;nbsp;One question is does fish consumption ameliorate the affects of pro-inflammatory AA, and is that why populations who eat fish tend to have better moods than those who don't? &amp;nbsp;Hey, let's whip up a little experiment and get informed consent and run it by the IRB and test it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So… 39 adults who ate meat or poultry once daily (thus omnivorous) with no major psychiatric problems, substance abuse, or health problems were randomized to three groups for two weeks. &amp;nbsp;One group was told not to change their diets (OMN). &amp;nbsp;Another group was told to avoid meat and poultry but to eat fish 3-4 times a week (FISH). &amp;nbsp;The last group was told to avoid all animal products except dairy (VEG). &amp;nbsp;(Traditionally in the US eggs are considered dairy for whatever reason but I'm assuming they were left out as the yolks have a nice dose of AA). &amp;nbsp; Diets before and after were assessed by a "validated food frequency questionnaire." &amp;nbsp;The participants were also given a bunch of mood, anxiety, and depression rating scales before and after. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results! &amp;nbsp;OMN and FISH groups were about the same with no change from baseline, but the VEG group showed a decrease in the psychological ratings scores with respect to tension and stress (anxiety and depression scores were not significantly changed). &amp;nbsp;Dietarily, if one can truly believe a report to a hundredth of a gram of dietary fatty acids based on food frequency questionnaires, EPA and DHA and AA dropped considerably in the VEG group, OMN group was unchanged, and the FISH group managed to increase their dietary long chain omega 3 fatty acid consumption by 100%. &amp;nbsp;They also successfully raised the O6/O3 ratio by 60% in the diet of the vegetarians, which I'm not enthusiastic about long term, by any means.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hooray! &amp;nbsp;A result. &amp;nbsp;Decreased tension and stress. &amp;nbsp;But what does it mean? &amp;nbsp;I'm hoping this pilot trial is used as evidence to recruit funding for a bigger and more ambitious trial, because what these researchers did not measure is pretty much everything that would tell us anything about what actually happened to decrease those stress scores. &amp;nbsp;There were no measures of tissue fatty acids to tell us how the ratios changed in the body relative to these dietary changes, and no "after" measures of weight. &amp;nbsp; Losing weight from a diet is associated with improved psychological scores, and since vegetarian-geared fare is often healthier than the regular SAD meaty counterparts (tofurky and cheese pizza excepted), I wouldn't be surprised if the most dramatically altered diet caused more weight loss than the others. &amp;nbsp;Or it might have to do with changes in AA. &amp;nbsp;The Seventh Day Adventists study (which the authors if this study did as well!!) showed that "&lt;a href="http://www.nutritionj.com/content/9/1/26"&gt;Vegetarian Diets Are Associated with Healthy Mood States&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(My critique of the SDA studies are that being part of a close-knit community that is very pro-vegetarianism is a HUGE confounder when it comes to mood and stress, and boy, it sure would be nice to know the tissue levels of fatty acids because that would tell us a lot more than just food frequency questionnaires and psych scales.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We need more info to make anything of this little study. &amp;nbsp;I also think the title is misleading (and is leading to &lt;a href="http://www.fyiliving.com/diet/special-diets/vegetarian-diet/are-vegetarians-happier-people/"&gt;misleading news reports&lt;/a&gt;, as is typical), as actual mood and anxiety scores were unchanged, only the tension and stress scores (though certainly over the long term tension and stress are associated with more depressed and anxious mood states). &amp;nbsp;Whatever gets you funding, I suppose…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3045634714760830992-31412542253545816?l=evolutionarypsychiatry.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>http://evolutionarypsychiatry.blogspot.com/2012/02/meatless-and-happy-in-short-term.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Emily Deans)</author><thr:total>7</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3045634714760830992.post-2798935775874651014</guid><pubDate>Sun, 19 Feb 2012 20:24:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2012-02-19T15:32:37.224-05:00</atom:updated><title>Seasonal Variations in Thyroid Hormones</title><description>Just a little bit of an information post to get a handle on things and to open up some more lines of questions…in that vein:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBZgHVXGyBg"&gt;This Head I Hold&lt;/a&gt; by Electric Guest (right click to open in new tab)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;(Oh, be sure to look at the initial post for a &lt;a href="http://evolutionarypsychiatry.blogspot.com/2012/02/thyroid-and-psychiatric-illness.html"&gt;short thyroid primer&lt;/a&gt; if you aren't up on your T4s, T3s, and TSHs). &amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I'm having a little trouble nailing down consistent reports in the literature of seasonal hormonal variation. &amp;nbsp;The papers are old and often the studies were awfully small, and I'm also trying to get a handle on variations of thyroid hormones within the menstrual cycle, which might invalidate some of the results in the women in the studies if they were not controlled for stage of menstrual cycle. I'm not sure how important that is, however, as I can't find any consistent recommendations to measure TSH at a particular time of the menstrual cycle. &amp;nbsp;Estrogen will increase the amount of thyroid binding globulin, which will tend to bind up more T4 and T3. &amp;nbsp;With thyroid function especially the newest studies use far more accurate hormonal assays, but we just have to look at what the results say and keep an eye out for new studies. &amp;nbsp;One of the better papers is from the &lt;i&gt;American Journal of Clinical Nutrition; &lt;/i&gt;"&lt;a href="http://www.ajcn.org/content/40/6/1352.full.pdf"&gt;Seasonal variation in plasma glucose and hormone levels in adult men and women&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;i&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;According to some other papers linking this one, the results seem to be fairly consistent in several different studies of normal controls but not in folks with seasonal depression (&lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1774423"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;). &amp;nbsp;In short:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Fasting glucose levels are lowest in the spring and summer and highest in the fall and winter. &amp;nbsp;Accordingly, there are more diagnoses of new cases of type II diabetes in the fall and winter. &amp;nbsp;Fasting insulin was also significantly lower in the spring than in the fall.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Among the thyroid hormones, all people had normal levels through all seasons, but there were significant differences between the levels from season to season, and the levels also seemed to differ by sex. &amp;nbsp;All the measurements were taken in the morning after an overnight fast.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Total T4 was highest in the summer. &amp;nbsp;Free T4 was highest in summer and fall and lowest in the spring, with men having higher levels than women during the fall and winter and women having higher levels than men during the summer. &amp;nbsp;Total T3 was highest in the winter. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;There was a negative correlation between glucose and free T4, and a significant positive correlation between T4 and the amount of carbohydrate and sugar consumed. &amp;nbsp;The only major differences in eating across the seasons was an increase in sugar intake among men in the spring, and a lower fiber intake in men in the fall and in women in the winter.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The interesting thing is that in a study of 148 untreated men and women with depression, there were no differences in the thyroid hormones across seasons (though they did not measure the same people across seasons as it wouldn't pass the IRB to merely follow depressed people for a year without trying to treat them somehow). &amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;What does it all mean? &amp;nbsp;Well, let's start with going over how T4 becomes T3. &amp;nbsp;Both are made and released by the thyroid, though humans release about 15 times as much T4 as T3 from the thyroid (&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Clinical-Management-Thyroid-Disease-1e/dp/141604745X"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;). &amp;nbsp;In addition, some enzymes called deiodinases change T4 into T3 in the body, and this mechanism is the major one by which active thyroid hormone (T3) is made. &amp;nbsp; The deiodinases have a little pocket in them with a selenium molecule where the transformations occur. &amp;nbsp;Iron is also required along the way to make thyroid hormone. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;There are three types of deiodinases. &amp;nbsp;D1 and D3 live on the plasma (outer) membrane of cells. &amp;nbsp;D2 is within the &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=http://micro.magnet.fsu.edu/cells/endoplasmicreticulum/images/endoplasmicreticulumfigure1.jpg&amp;amp;imgrefurl=http://micro.magnet.fsu.edu/cells/endoplasmicreticulum/endoplasmicreticulum.html&amp;amp;h=286&amp;amp;w=402&amp;amp;sz=44&amp;amp;tbnid=nCYKX9rqWjAXoM:&amp;amp;tbnh=90&amp;amp;tbnw=127&amp;amp;prev=/search%3Fq%3Dendoplasmic%2Breticulum%26tbm%3Disch%26tbo%3Du&amp;amp;zoom=1&amp;amp;q=endoplasmic+reticulum&amp;amp;docid=YZ0TlBm4a5sBKM&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ei=3khBT4CqJMHW0QGX4tTpBw&amp;amp;ved=0CDwQ9QEwAg&amp;amp;dur=2570"&gt;endoplasmic reticulum&lt;/a&gt; within a cell. &amp;nbsp;D2 therefore creates active thyroid hormone much closer to the nucleus of the cell, where thyroid hormones exert most of their effects. &amp;nbsp;D2 is the most important deiodinase in the nerves and brain. &amp;nbsp;D2 has a very short half life (40 minutes) and its expression is tightly controlled. &amp;nbsp;Both high levels of T4 and reverse T3 can downregulate D2. &amp;nbsp;D2 is also the important go-between in how T4 levels regulate the amount of TSH secretion from the anterior pituitary (I know. &amp;nbsp;All endocrinology is like this, and understanding it is a bit like being a card counter in Vegas.)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;D1 and D3, on the other hand, have longer half lives and seem to be more responsible for the serum (blood) circulating levels of thyroid hormones. &amp;nbsp;D1 makes T4 into T3 (though it can also inactivate T3), and D3 preferentially inactivates T3 by making it into reverse T3. &amp;nbsp;In times of iodine shortage or hypothyroidism, the brain can decrease the activity of D3 by about 90% while increasing the activity of D2, which leaves more T3 around a lot longer to protect the brain from an iodine deficiency. &amp;nbsp;Pretty cool. &amp;nbsp;In rats, when they are made iodine deficient, their serum and tissue T4 become almost unmeasureable, while brain T3 levels decreased only by 50%. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;A quick recap to solidify the facts in your brain: &amp;nbsp;D1 and D2 can make T4 into the active T3. &amp;nbsp;D3 makes T3 into inactive reverse T3. &amp;nbsp;D2 is found within the cell near the nuclear action, D1 and D3 on the surface of cells.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;So systemically, T3 and T4 levels remain pretty stable throughout the body, but intracellularly, depending on the actions of D2, T3 can be much higher. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;In the liver and kidneys, without much D2, T3 at normal physiologic levels occupies about 50% of the nuclear thyroid hormone receptors (TRs). &amp;nbsp;In the central nervous system where there is a lot of D2, nuclear thyroid hormone receptor occupancy can be close to 95%.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;D2 is also found in brown fat (which helps to regulate body temperature). &amp;nbsp;At room temperature, around 70% of the TRs are occupied by thyroid hormone. &amp;nbsp;In the cold, 100% of TRs are occupied. &amp;nbsp;Heat is generated in brown fat in part by uncoupling protein 1 (UCP-1), which is made in response to T3. &amp;nbsp;T3 also seems to increase the activity of fat-burning enzymes in response to cold. &amp;nbsp;It's important, however, to know that in these animal studies, the serum levels of T3 were relatively unchanged whether it was cold or room temperature. &amp;nbsp;All the action seemed to be happening intracellularly, with D2 then having tissue-specific metabolic effects by affecting the levels of T3 within the cells. &amp;nbsp;T3 changes within the cells may also explain changes in basal metabolic rate in response to different diets. &amp;nbsp;High carbohydrate diets in the context of eating too much (&lt;a href="http://www.jci.org/articles/view/109590"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;), for example, may increase D2 activity in humans, who may have more brown fat than previously thought, and who also might have more D2 activity in skeletal muscle than previously thought. &amp;nbsp;Thyroid hormone is one of the few truly potent stimulators of metabolic rate.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;All these findings elucidate an elegant system, wherein individual cells and tissues can respond to relatively wide variations in normal serum T3 and T4 levels. &amp;nbsp;It also shows us how we can preserve thyroid hormone function in times of iodine shortage. &amp;nbsp;On the other hand, it is hard to interpret some of these small variations in thyroid hormone function as the serum levels may have very little to do with what is going on within the cell, where all the action is. &amp;nbsp;Certainly in cases of severe iodine deficiency or thyroid disease or pituitary disease we can see the large and predictable changes in hormone levels and decipher their meaning and see how they will affect the physiology of the body.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The much smaller seasonal and nonthyroidal or euthyroid sick syndrome changes are much trickier. &amp;nbsp;What do we make of no significant seasonal differences in (serum) thyroid hormone levels in folks with seasonal depression, but a normal mild variation in healthy people? &amp;nbsp;Is that difference (a higher T3, perhaps) what makes us survive the winter with a smile? &amp;nbsp;I don't know. &amp;nbsp;We do know that in critically ill patients, tissue D3 expression is increased, thus reducing T3 and increasing reverse T3. &amp;nbsp;In fasting, a continuous administration of TRH can reverse the dropping T3 and T4 levels, suggesting that perhaps the central hypothalamic mechanism of reduced TRH in response to fasting (which can be reversed by leptin and feeding) may be more important than the peripheral mechanism.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Got that? &amp;nbsp;Heh. &amp;nbsp;There are consistent changes in summer and winter in thyroid hormone activity (but not in the disease state of seasonal depression). &amp;nbsp;These changes were not dependent on carbohydrate intake, though increasing carbohydrate does increase active thyroid hormone and fasting will decrease it. &amp;nbsp;If one thinks of an abundant summer and a lean winter, perhaps the increases in T3 in the winter is meant to compensate. &amp;nbsp;Would it compensate for a diet presumably lower in carbohydrate/plant matter in the winter? &amp;nbsp;Would it matter if humans evolved for most of the time near the equator? &amp;nbsp;Much of the study of thyroid hormone is done in reptiles (thyroid hormone is very important in stages of metamorphasis and reptilian development)--are these seasonal changes remnants of even earlier evolutionary signals? I don't think I have the breadth of knowledge to properly contemplate these questions. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;But I'll keep looking. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3045634714760830992-2798935775874651014?l=evolutionarypsychiatry.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>http://evolutionarypsychiatry.blogspot.com/2012/02/seasonal-variations-in-thyroid-hormones.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Emily Deans)</author><thr:total>8</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3045634714760830992.post-8229569826221950457</guid><pubDate>Sun, 12 Feb 2012 21:52:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2012-02-12T17:57:15.500-05:00</atom:updated><title>The Treatment of Depression with T3</title><description>Psychiatry is one of the few specialties where we are "allowed" to use T3 (the active thyroid hormone, instead of the safer prohormone T4) for treatment of resistant depression. &amp;nbsp;(Please see yesterday's post for a &lt;a href="http://evolutionarypsychiatry.blogspot.com/2012/02/thyroid-and-psychiatric-illness.html"&gt;thyroid primer&lt;/a&gt;). &amp;nbsp;The literature for its use is extensive but old. &amp;nbsp;Much of it was done before there were very reliable lab tests for thryoid function, so symptoms such as pulse, insomnia, anxiety, palpitations and reflexes were measured to judge whether someone was made "hyperthyroid" with the treatment or not. &amp;nbsp;I suppose that made them bolder, back in the day (also, there were very few options, medication-speaking, so all the people studying resistant depression did a little study on T3. &amp;nbsp;For the same reason there is a ton of data on lithium for bipolar disorder. It was the only game in town for decades.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any event, I thought I would take the opportunity to catch up on the latest and greatest in T3 supplementation and safety issues, particularly since the very large &lt;a href="http://www.edc.gsph.pitt.edu/stard/"&gt;STAR-D&lt;/a&gt; trial used T3 and found it equally efficacious in resistant depression to lithium use, and better than many other pharmaceutical tinctures. &amp;nbsp;Fortunately there is an up to date review from the Green Journal, &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21969047"&gt;T3 Augmentation in Major Depressive Disorder: &amp;nbsp;Safety Considerations&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;The article had a number of interesting points, particularly with regards to the standard endocrinology method of treating hypothyroidism with T4 monotherapy. &amp;nbsp;I'll get to that in a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All right. &amp;nbsp;So the weakness of most of the studies is that they were short, typically 2-12 weeks. &amp;nbsp;Also, most of them were studies of augmentation or acceleration with the old-fashioned antidepressants, the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tricyclic_antidepressant"&gt;tricyclics&lt;/a&gt; (or TCAs). &amp;nbsp;And when I think of the tricyclics, I think of a cruder but much more medication-stringent time. &amp;nbsp;TCAs have lots of side effects (weight gain, dry mouth, fast heartbeat) and are fatal in overdose. &amp;nbsp;However, they are effective for many, &amp;nbsp;and folks with very serious depression where they were nonfunctional and suicidal who responded to the medicine would take them because being without proved worse than the side effects of being on them. &amp;nbsp;The SSRIs, with fewer (but still not insignificant) side effects had not yet been invented, and mildly depressed women were still being given B12 shots by their primary care doctors, who also advised them to smoke to give them energy and motivation. &amp;nbsp;(Or gave them a tiny bit of dexedrine in the morning and some barbituates at night.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So we are dealing with a subset of very depressed people who do not respond to the tricyclics. &amp;nbsp;They don't seem to be hypothyroid by physical symptoms or the lab tests of the time, but a certain percentage would respond to augmentation with active thyroid hormone. &amp;nbsp;In addition, "accelerating" the tricyclics (which, like most antidepressants, take several weeks to kick in) with a dose of T3 up front (isolated to 2-4 weeks, then discontinued) seemed to work too. &amp;nbsp;There are fewer studies of augmentation with SSRIs, but these are also short and the results are less definitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why would T3 help? What does T3 do in the central nervous system? Well, a lot. &amp;nbsp;The thyroid has fingers in almost every physiological pie, after all. &amp;nbsp;And T3 not only may act as a direct neurotransmitter, but it also seems to increase the efficiency of serotonin signaling, much like a modern SSRI. &amp;nbsp;T3 also enhances neurogenesis in the central nervous system and could also enhance &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noradrenergic"&gt;noradrenergic&lt;/a&gt; signaling. &amp;nbsp;The conversion from T4 to T3 occurs all over the body, but in the central nervous system it uses &lt;i&gt;different&lt;/i&gt; active genes than in the periphery and occurs within the cells. &amp;nbsp;These differences could explain my own clinical observations--that T3 augmentation seems to work best in folks already diagnosed hypothyroid that are on T4 monotherapy. &amp;nbsp;And the literature (such as it is) seems to support my observation (&lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1737734"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I am ignoring selenium and iodine deficiency for the moment as does this literature. &amp;nbsp;Much of North America has fairly selenium-rich soil except some of the Eastern Coastal plain. &amp;nbsp;Given the wide geographic distribution of vegetables and other produce, frank selenium deficiency is rare. &amp;nbsp;Also, with the advent of iodized salt, frank iodine deficiency is also rare so that babies are very rarely born with congenital hypothyroidism. &amp;nbsp;These facts do not mean that our selenium and iodine levels are optimized, but, again, I would say a frank deficiency is rare).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the good news is that T3 augmentation seems to help some and (relying on some limited longer-term data up to several years) it seems to be relatively safe (particularly in the short term), though post-menopausal women need to watch the possible side effect of osteoporosis, and there is a continued risk of heart arrhythmia. &amp;nbsp;So in heart-healthy and strong-boned folks with a serious bout of depression, a small dose of T3 is a good option, &lt;i&gt;even if they are clinically and by laboratory measure euthyroid &lt;/i&gt;(normal thyroid) particularly if they are the type to have serious episodes and then bounce back, rather than the more chronically low-grade depressed people. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The goal for longer-term treatment is to use a dose that keeps TSH at the low end of normal (or even somewhat below normal if there are no hyperthyroid symptoms) and free T3 at the high end of normal (I can tell you that the recommended dose of 25-50mcg almost always seems to overshoot this goal, but it probably reflects the long history of shorter-term studies), while monitoring bone density and cardiac side effects frequently, particularly in post-menopausal women. &amp;nbsp; T3 augmentation does seem to work better in folks with higher TSH and lower free T3s at baseline, suggesting we are, indeed, treating a type of "subclinical hypothyroidism" with depression symptoms, maybe those who convert T4 to T3 just fine in the periphery but who are poor converters in the central nervous system. &amp;nbsp;Again, this would support my clinical observation of long term treatment. &amp;nbsp;Fairly useless in the euthyroid except for temporary severe exacerbations, but useful in the hypothyroid or subclinical hypothyroid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And what about those endocrinologists who are so very down on combination therapy with T3 and T4 for hypothyroidism? &amp;nbsp;I've had some tell me point blank (over the phone) there is &lt;i&gt;no&lt;/i&gt; literature support for treatment of hypothyroidism with anything but T4 monotherapy. &amp;nbsp;I've had to pull out the "psychiatric indication" card and then they will back off, mostly because most folks in medicine are a little scared of psychiatrists and psychiatric patients. &amp;nbsp;There's &lt;a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/1989-37482-001"&gt;a little bit of literature&lt;/a&gt; of psychiatrists as the last shamans of Western medicine. &amp;nbsp;We don't typically wear the white coats. &amp;nbsp;We treat the unexplained. &amp;nbsp;We exist apart. &amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://evolutionarypsychiatry.blogspot.com/2011/09/further-evidence-that-mental-illness.html"&gt;We may well be witch doctors&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;In the US, insurance payments regard "mental health" and "medical" as separate entities. &amp;nbsp;But I'm wandering a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, what about that literature for combination therapy (T3 and T4) vs monotherapy (T4 alone) for hypothyroidism? &amp;nbsp;Multiple studies and a meta-analysis have proven no benefit for combination therapy over T4 alone. &amp;nbsp;However, in several studies, patients had a preference for combination therapy that could not be explained by lab results or quality of life measurements. &amp;nbsp;In Denmark, &lt;a href="http://eje-online.org/content/161/6/895.long"&gt;one study&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;using double-blind crossover methods treated patients with T3/T4 or T4 alone to equivalent TSH levels. &amp;nbsp;49% of the patients preferred combination therapy compared to 15% who preferred T4 monotherapy, and quality of life measures and depression and anxiety ratings were generally better on combination therapy than on T4 alone. &amp;nbsp;T4 monotherapy is safer, less likely to result in hyperthyroidism. &amp;nbsp;But to say there is &lt;i&gt;no&lt;/i&gt; support for the alternative is incorrect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the evolutionary point of view in general a bit of seaweed and some selenium won't hurt. &amp;nbsp;In the case of Hashimoto's one must take care with iodine supplementation lest one worsen the condition (this seems less likely to happen if selenium is topped off). &amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/evolutionary-psychiatry/201110/selenium-and-the-brain"&gt;Selenium excess is also a pretty bad idea&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But looking at the more modern basis of hypothyroid and depression treatment, the science behind T4 monotherapy is not yet ironclad. &amp;nbsp;T3 might yet come back from its banishment to psychiatry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3045634714760830992-8229569826221950457?l=evolutionarypsychiatry.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>http://evolutionarypsychiatry.blogspot.com/2012/02/treatment-of-depression-with-t3.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Emily Deans)</author><thr:total>23</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3045634714760830992.post-1209569813221830738</guid><pubDate>Fri, 10 Feb 2012 17:43:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2012-02-11T09:45:33.922-05:00</atom:updated><title>Thyroid and Psychiatric Illness</title><description>The thyroid is one of those glands that is hooked into everything. &amp;nbsp;Mood, cognition, metabolism, bones, heart, cholesterol… all can be affected by perturbations among the thyroid hormones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chris Kresser has done a &lt;a href="http://chriskresser.com/thyroid"&gt;great series of articles&lt;/a&gt; and it's worth a look if you are unfamiliar with the thyroid or if you want a comprehensive refresher. &amp;nbsp;In fact he did such a good job it seems hardly worth reinventing the wheel, so I thought I would start with psychiatric disease and then address any questions and chase the rabbit holes that will inevitably open up. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My information today comes from a review done for the &lt;i&gt;American Journal of Psychiatry&lt;/i&gt; this month and pointed out to me by my fantastic colleague Dr. Hale: &lt;a href="http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/article.aspx?articleid=483664"&gt;&amp;nbsp;Abnormal Thyroid Function Tests in Psychiatric Patients: &amp;nbsp;A Red Herring?&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; This review is conventional to the extreme, but I find it is often very useful to start with conventional reasoning and pick apart where there may be issues or something missing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will begin with the briefest of primers so that we are more or less on the same page:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Killers, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hw2vBYBE24Y"&gt;All These Things That I've Done&lt;/a&gt; (right click to open in new tab)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All right. &amp;nbsp;As with everything endocrine, there is a feedback loop, but for our purposes we will start with the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothalamus"&gt;hypothalamus&lt;/a&gt;, which makes a chemical called thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH). &amp;nbsp;This chemical toodles on down to the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_pituitary"&gt;anterior pituitary&lt;/a&gt;, which produces thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). &amp;nbsp;TSH then directs the thyroid gland itself to release thyroid hormone. &amp;nbsp;The two major ones are T3 (&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triiodothyronine"&gt;triiodothyronine&lt;/a&gt;) and T4 (&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroxine"&gt;thyroxine&lt;/a&gt;). &amp;nbsp;High levels of T3 and T4 should feedback to the pituitary and cause it to decrease the amount of TSH secreted, thus nicely regulating itself. &amp;nbsp;The other important thing to know is that iodine is essential for the creation of the thyroid hormones, and that T4 is actually a prohormone (and is the major hormone secreted by the thyroid) while T3 is the active hormone. &amp;nbsp;Selenium is required to turn T4 into T3. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto;

If someone comes to my office with weight gain, cold intolerance, fatigue, and depression, I'd better well check the thyroid and grab a pulse rate while I'm at it. &amp;nbsp;I'd look pretty silly treating hypothyroidism with therapy or antidepressants. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides these basic thyroid problems, thyroid hormones can be off kilter in a variety of other ways. &amp;nbsp;Chris Kresser's series goes into great detail, but with rare exceptions, these abnormalities are not due to thyroid problems in the actual gland. &amp;nbsp;Alterations in thyroid function can occur in response to all sorts of systemic illnesses, stress states, and medications, and perturbations in the thyroid function tests not thought to be due to actual hypo or hyperthyroidism is called "nonthyroidal illness." &lt;i&gt;In general&lt;/i&gt;, any pattern of tests that don't quite fit the classic &amp;nbsp;hypo/hyperthyroid patterns will indicate a nonthyroidal illness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sepsis, heart attack, major surgery, autoimmune disease… all of these can lead to a characteristic pattern of thyroid tests including low T3, normal to low T4, and high reverse T3. &amp;nbsp;TSH is often normal, but can be low and later become elevated during recovery. &amp;nbsp;These abnormalities are extremely common and are seen in about 75% of hospitalized medical patients. &amp;nbsp;The kicker is these abnormalities seem to be a physiologic response to the illness and they resolve without any intervention in a few months. &amp;nbsp;The reason these changes happen is (as always) complicated, but inflammatory cytokines such IL-6, IL-1, and TNF alpha are likely involved, altering feedback regulation along the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Starvation, fasting, or a very low carb diet can tend to lead to low TSH, normal or slightly elevated free T4, and low T3. &amp;nbsp;There is nothing wrong with the thyroid and this is not "hypothyroidism" per se, but a normal physiologic response to perceived starvation, and it should resolve without other intervention once someone stops fasting or increases carbohydrate intake. &amp;nbsp;Sepsis (severe infection) will often present with low TSH, normal free T4, and low free T3, a similar pattern. &amp;nbsp;Again, once the infection is cleared, the abnormalities will resolve on their own. &amp;nbsp;This "low T3" syndrome is a bad predictor in the case of cardiovascular disease (&lt;a href="http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/107/5/708.long"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;), but that doesn't mean that treating with T3 would be smart. &amp;nbsp;There is some reason to suspect that "low T3" may be a maladaptive response and T3 after a heart attack may be a good idea after all (&lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3134399/?tool=pubmed"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;), but I think the proof will be in future research (&lt;a href="http://jcem.endojournals.org/content/95/10/4526.long"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As we noted before, primary thyroid problems can cause psychiatric symptoms. &amp;nbsp;However, the reverse is also true, and up to 33% of psychiatric inpatients will have abnormal thyroid tests. &amp;nbsp;As in the case of the medical "nonthyroidal illness," these abnormalities will tend to be characteristic of the disorder and will also resolve on their own within a few months. &amp;nbsp;In acute psychosis, for example, TSH is usually normal while total T4 is often elevated. &amp;nbsp;In mania, total T4 and free T4 will be elevated. &amp;nbsp;In depression, TSH may be a little low or high, with a high free T4 and low or high total T3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In general, it is recommended that nonthyroidal illness is NOT treated with thyroid hormone. &amp;nbsp;In nonthyroidal illness, the low T3 or other abnormality may be part of the adaptive inflammatory response (I've linked some thoughts about possible exceptions above). &amp;nbsp;This reasoning is why conventional medicine suggests testing TSH alone, and checking other hormone levels only if the TSH is out of whack. &amp;nbsp;Without multiple findings indicative of thyroid problems (a typical hyper or hypothyroid) symptom complex, it is unlikely to be a primary thyroid issue, except in the elderly, who can sometimes show few symptoms. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Other folks with a history or family history of autoimmune disease, treatment with lithium, radiation exposure, goiter, etc. are obviously at higher risk for primary thyroid disease and one should have higher suspicion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Subclinical hypothyroidism" is a bit of a gray area between true thyroid illness and the nonthyroidal problems. &amp;nbsp;TSH will be high, while free T4 will be low or normal. Usually multiple hypothyroid symptoms will indicate a thyroid problem, while no symptoms will indicate nonthyroidal illness and will resolve on its own, which should show up in serial lab tests over months. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From my perspective as a physician, I tend to rely on the TSH and not aggressively pursue mildly abnormal T4s or T3s, particularly if there are no other symptoms. &amp;nbsp;However, I think low grade iodine and selenium deficiencies are rarely thought of by a conventional physician and may lead to thyroid symptoms and subclinical or confusing lab results. ("&lt;a href="http://chriskresser.com/chris-masterjohn-on-cholesterol-and-heart-disease-part-3"&gt;Are you eating too much millet&lt;/a&gt;? Is not a typical question in the standard medical interview). In addition, there is some controversy as to the appropriate range of TSH considered normal. &amp;nbsp;In the past it was around 0.8 or 1.0-6. &amp;nbsp;Now many labs have narrowed the threshold by reducing the upper limit to 3.5 or 4. &amp;nbsp;However, in most true hyperthyroidism (99%) there will not be much of a question -- TSH will be undetectable. &amp;nbsp;In true hypothyroidism, it is not unusual to see levels higher than 20.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TSH levels &amp;gt;2.5 are associated with a greater risk of cardiovascular disease. &amp;nbsp;But is that due to other factors, such as systemic inflammation? &amp;nbsp;Does it make sense to use thyroid hormone to treat a mere number? &amp;nbsp;How is that different from treating a cholesterol number with a medicine for the specific purpose of getting the number into a "better" range? &amp;nbsp;I think we are still coming to a consensus as to the right thing to do in the case of "subclinical hypothyroidism."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As we discussed in the &lt;a href="http://evolutionarypsychiatry.blogspot.com/2012/02/magnesium-deficiency-and-fibromyalgia.html"&gt;comments of a previous post&lt;/a&gt;, psychiatry is pretty much the only specialty where we have a large amount of data and clinical reason for using T3 hormone to treat depression symptoms. &amp;nbsp;Most primary care doctors and endocrinologists will use T4 exclusively. &amp;nbsp;In general, T4 the prohormone is safer, and the body should be able to make about as much T3 as it needs (provided selenium levels and vitamin levels are okay). &amp;nbsp;Conversely, being too aggressive with T3 can lead to death. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, as I noted, I've found T3 to be generally ineffective or uncomfortable for most, and the only folks who seem to respond well already have diagnosed hypothyroidism and are on synthetic T4. &amp;nbsp;I've also found that the recommended psychiatry doses (25 to 50 mcg T3) are way too high, and lead to mild hyperthyroidism symptoms within several months. &amp;nbsp;I've had better luck with lower doses of T3 (around 5 mcg) combined with lowering the dose of T4. &amp;nbsp;My anecdotes are hardly data, but I think I might have caught some poor converters from T4 to T3, or maybe they are &lt;a href="http://thyroid.about.com/library/weekly/aa072000a.htm"&gt;selenium deficient&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;In conventional endocrinology these folks don't really exist, but I'm usually able to get away with treatment if I document "for psychiatric indication."&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3045634714760830992-1209569813221830738?l=evolutionarypsychiatry.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>http://evolutionarypsychiatry.blogspot.com/2012/02/thyroid-and-psychiatric-illness.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Emily Deans)</author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-EyaWaVkVOlE/TzU_6qVqkfI/AAAAAAAAARU/S5kdUdKdtng/s72-c/Illu_thyroid_parathyroid.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>8</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3045634714760830992.post-5666109206185486193</guid><pubDate>Thu, 09 Feb 2012 21:45:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2012-02-09T17:58:10.348-05:00</atom:updated><title>Upcoming Talks and Topics</title><description>Foster the People, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haca2VY2fFY"&gt;Don't Stop&lt;/a&gt;

Geriatric Interest Group meeting in Wellesley, Massachusetts. &amp;nbsp;I'll be doing a talk for psychiatrists who specialize in treating the elderly on Evolutionary Medicine and Alzheimer's Disease. &amp;nbsp;I'm thrilled for this opportunity to speak to my peers, as I've trained in conservative institutions, and I have the tendency to believe that any psychiatrist who reads my blog will think I'm a crackpot. &amp;nbsp;For this reason I'm sure the talk will be squeaky clean with regards to literature references and the best accuracy I can muster, and hopefully exciting and thought-provoking for the attendees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;August 9-12 at the &lt;a href="http://ancestryfoundation.org/"&gt;Ancestral Health Symposium 2012&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;in Cambridge.&amp;nbsp; I'll be doing a short presentation and will really enjoy seeing all my paleosphere friends again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also been asked about possibly speaking for the Boston-area Paleo Interest group perhaps in the spring but I believe we were going to regroup after holidays/winter, as it is nearly useless making plans when there might be a big snowstorm (ironically the only one we've had was last October, the day before I spoke at Harvard Law School!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My plan for upcoming blog topics: &amp;nbsp;Finally, at long last, for real, the Thyroid, with a focus on psychiatric implications. &amp;nbsp;The first in this series may even come tonight… but more likely tomorrow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then I plan to take on that interesting alt med diagnosis known as adrenal fatigue. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still have stacks of other interesting papers, plus the new ones that come up. &amp;nbsp;Always more interesting things than I could possibly have time to look into. &amp;nbsp;And a number of books that need book reviews. &amp;nbsp;Any tremendously wealthy reader willing to sponsor a year's salary so I can catch up is more than welcome to do so ;-) Of course then I would be spoiled for any future clinical endeavors and lose my usefulness as an active, front-lines interpreter of the literature, so perhaps I'm much better off with the status quo. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3045634714760830992-5666109206185486193?l=evolutionarypsychiatry.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>http://evolutionarypsychiatry.blogspot.com/2012/02/upcoming-talks-and-topics.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Emily Deans)</author><thr:total>0</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3045634714760830992.post-5887227198755505187</guid><pubDate>Sat, 04 Feb 2012 21:44:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2012-02-04T16:48:50.167-05:00</atom:updated><title>Magnesium Deficiency and Fibromyalgia</title><description>Free the Animal's Richard Nikoley may &lt;a href="http://freetheanimal.com/2012/02/whos-the-worstest-of-them-all.html"&gt;have no use for government&lt;/a&gt;

Even then we had Wargames-era computerized search engines. Half the time you would get sent to something on microfiche and you would give up. In medical school, Medline, MedlinePlus, Ovid, and LoansomeDoc were still ways to search (and you still had to comb the library for the actual paper journal nearly all of the time). In most cases we would do almost anything to avoid a literature search and generally gave presentations straight from textbooks. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look at me now. Voluntarily doing literature searches for the purposes of gaining knowledge and stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Ting Tings: &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHzgzN9H6QM&amp;amp;feature=relmfu"&gt;&amp;nbsp;Hang it Up&lt;/a&gt; (right click to open in new tab--VEVO so there's an ad the first time through. &amp;nbsp;Sorry about that, but I think this song is a new, and it is rockin'.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now if the whole shebang could be shifted to &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/"&gt;PubMed Central&lt;/a&gt; and free full text were the norm…well. &amp;nbsp;I suppose my school (I'm not going to mention the name of it, because we all know &lt;a href="http://evolutionarypsychiatry.blogspot.com/2012/01/glorious-cause.html"&gt;what happened&lt;/a&gt; the last time) would have to find some other way to pay me for my teaching duties than academic journal access. Maybe money of some kind, a discount on malpractice insurance, a holiday basket, a free MRI or something. But for now I get PubMed's friendly &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/myncbi/"&gt;My NCBI&lt;/a&gt; to email me automatically and regularly with searches of interest. And then I'm able to plug the search results into my school's online academic access for full text so the emails are not a horrible tease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes I get a lot of results for boring articles about rats on ketogenic diets, or the latest review in Hungarian about sleep disorders. Sometimes I hit the veritable Evolutionary Psychiatry jackpot, relatively speaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="font: 15.9px Times; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22271372"&gt;Is magnesium citrate treatment effective on pain, clinical parameters and functional status in patients with fibromyalgia?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's a small study, 60 women with fibromyalgia. Nothing definitive but certainly very interesting. Have I talked about &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0001463/"&gt;fibromyalgia&lt;/a&gt; before? It's a disease characterized mostly by generalized muscle pains and body aches, fatigue, and poor sleep. Like irritable bowel syndrome, a good proportion of the folks I see in my outpatient clinic that I see for anxiety or depressive disorders have been diagnosed with fibromyalgia. I would say men tend to be more on the irritable bowel side while the afflicted women generally have a nice helping of both, in combination with long term anxiety, depression, and often some autoimmune arthritis or skin issues. Fibromyalgia is one of those debilitating conditions that many doctors (and lay people) consider the 21st century version of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hysteria"&gt;hysteria&lt;/a&gt;, partially because there are no definitive biomarkers, no x-ray findings, it tends to co-occur with depression and anxiety, and it can respond somewhat to certain antidepressants. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My guess is that fibromyalgia is a variant of depressive disorders that is mediated by a poorly regulated stress response combined with broken sleep, oxidative stress, and inflammation. There's very likely a gut microflora connection. I can further speculate that a program of stress reduction, a nutrient-rich, toxin-avoidant diet, sensible exercise and good sleep hygiene will go a long way to help a large percentage of those with fibromyalgia. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The diagnosis of fibromyalgia has become more popular recently because there is a shiny new Drug to treat it, &lt;a href="http://www.cymbalta.com/Pages/index.aspx?WT.seg_1=CYMBRAND&amp;amp;DCSext.ag=Brand%20Beta&amp;amp;WT.mc_ID=GGLCYMBRANDCore%20Term&amp;amp;WT.srch=1"&gt;Cymbalta&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;(duloxetine), which is also FDA-approved for major depressive disorder. There are, of course, no studies as far as I know for paleo diets combined with intensive lifestyle interventions for fibromyalgia, so it is madness and pseudoalternative crap medicine to promote that idea on my blog, whereas there is growing literature evidence for Cymbalta (and pregabalin and milnacipram, the other two FDA-approved treatments). Cymbalta is one of the class of second generation mixed norepinephrine and serotonin-reuptake inhibitors. And I would have to say, in my experience working with people, it really does seem to help the annoying, constant aches of fibromyalgia in many. Cymbalta can also cause weight gain, sedation and a host of other irritating antidepressant side effects, and it is expensive. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, the dirty little secret of expensive pharmaceuticals is that there are older, dirt-cheap antidepressants that are equally effective for fibromyalgia, called tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs). &amp;nbsp;To be perfectly fair, the TCAs are fatal in overdose and cause much more weight gain, sedation, and deal-breaking dry mouth than the second-generation Cymbalta.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what if there were an even cheaper, easier, less side-effect laden pill or supplement to take for fibromyalgia? How about magnesium? If you like more detail, go read my Psychology Today article, &lt;a href="http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/evolutionary-psychiatry/201106/magnesium-and-the-brain-the-original-chill-pill"&gt;Magnesium and the Brain: The Original Chill Pill&lt;/a&gt;. It combines the information from several articles from this blog. To summarize, magnesium deficiency can cause us to be more vulnerable to a poorly regulated stress response, and magnesium is absolutely necessary to metabolize energy efficiently. Many on a Standard American (or whatever) Diet are likely to be at least somewhat magnesium deficient. Since most magnesium is stored within cells and bones, a simple serum level generally won't tell us much. Since we die rather quickly of heart problems if our blood levels are low, our regulatory systems pull out all the stops to make sure our blood levels remain within a certain range, even if our bodies are relatively deficient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back to the study. These researchers took 60 women with fibromyalgia and 20 controls. &amp;nbsp;The patients were randomized into three groups, magnesium citrate 300mg daily, amitriptyline 10mg daily (a TCA), or Mg Citrate + amitriptyline for eight weeks. &amp;nbsp;Number of tender points and a "tender point index" were assessed. &amp;nbsp;Serum and red blood cell levels of magnesium were measured and followed. &amp;nbsp;In addition, all the participants took standard scale questionnaires measuring depression, anxiety, and fibromyalgia symptoms. &amp;nbsp;All of these measures were taken before and after treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why magnesium? &amp;nbsp;The researchers were intrigued by the idea of fibromyalgia being a disease of oxidative stress, and mineral deficiencies are known to predispose folks to oxidative stress. &amp;nbsp;Magnesium plays a critical role in the various processed turning the food we eat and our fuel stores into energy used by the cells. &amp;nbsp;It was postulated that muscle cells could be low in magnesium while the blood levels were maintained with normal limits (to preserve the heart), and this low magnesium could cause problems with muscle cells turning fuel into energy, thus fatigue, weakness, and pain. &amp;nbsp;A previous study showed that 300-600 mg of magnesium malate daily improved the symptoms of fibromyalgia (&lt;a href="http://drbobseiler.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/article_08-37_abraham.pdf"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;). &amp;nbsp;Another trial used a mix of magnesium supplements (low and high) with similar results to the previous study in the high-dose arm (&lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8587088"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the brand new study, here are the results:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;...magnesium levels [both serum and red blood cell] were lower [in fibromyalgia patients] than in the control groups and there was a correlation between&amp;nbsp;magnesium and &lt;a href="http://ergonomics.about.com/od/ergonomicbasics/ss/painscale.htm"&gt;VAS&lt;/a&gt;, the number of tender points, tender point index, the &lt;a href="http://www.myalgia.com/FIQ/FIQ_questionnaire.pdf"&gt;FIQ&lt;/a&gt;, the Beck depression and anxiety score and clinical symptoms such as fatigue, sleep disorder, headache, numbness and gastric disorders. All of these findings support the fact that magnesium plays an important role in the development of fibromyalgia.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's pretty impressive. &amp;nbsp;And here, then, appears to be the third trial showing clinical improvement with magnesium supplementation for fibromyalgia. &amp;nbsp;The patients who did best were on a combination of magnesium and amitriptyline (the 10mg dose is quite low and would not expect to have much in the way of antidepressant effects). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before we get too terribly excited, there are studies showing that &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21679091"&gt;sleeping medicines&lt;/a&gt; alone will help improve symptoms of fibromyalgia, and one of the most consistent reports of people taking magnesium is that sleep is improved. &amp;nbsp;Similarly, amitriptyline in a 10 or 25mg dose is often used off-label as a prescription sleep aid. &amp;nbsp;That might explain the improvement all on its own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But however the magnesium seems to help, that it does could be significant for many. &amp;nbsp;It certainly seems worth a try, considering the risks and benefits and costs of the FDA approved treatments (pregabalin, duloxetine, and milnacipram) and the multitude of benefits from getting one's magnesium levels up to snuff. &amp;nbsp;These are not massive doses. &amp;nbsp;Considering the average diet gives us maybe 250mg daily, adding 300mg daily puts us just a little above&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/magnesium/"&gt;the RDA&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;Seems sensible enough to me, anyway.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3045634714760830992-5887227198755505187?l=evolutionarypsychiatry.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>http://evolutionarypsychiatry.blogspot.com/2012/02/magnesium-deficiency-and-fibromyalgia.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Emily Deans)</author><thr:total>39</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3045634714760830992.post-629135129517439629</guid><pubDate>Wed, 01 Feb 2012 02:15:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2012-02-03T13:42:43.701-05:00</atom:updated><title>Medicine Is Still an Art</title><description>I'm going to go an unusual direction today and swerve from my normal focus on psychiatry to comment on the general direction of medicine. &amp;nbsp;In some ways, psychiatry, with its drug-heavy focus, is the forefront of medicine (and not in a good way), so perhaps it is not so far outside my specialty that I will make a fool of myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Young the Giant. &amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF5uvXV93hw"&gt;Cough Syrup&lt;/a&gt; (right click to open in new tab)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My thoughts are in response to a culmination of a number of recent news items in medicine. &amp;nbsp;First, at the end of 2011, an expert panel convened by the &lt;a href="http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/about/ncep/ncep_pd.htm"&gt;National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute&lt;/a&gt; recommended universal lipid screening in children 9-11 years of age and again at 17-21 years of age. &amp;nbsp;On surface this seems innocuous enough… from a conventional medicine standpoint when one considers cholesterol to be an important marker of health. &amp;nbsp;(Let's ignore for a little bit the fact that low cholesterol (along with exceptionally high) is associated with increased overall mortality in &lt;a href="http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(01)05553-2/fulltext"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; after study after &lt;a href="http://perfecthealthdiet.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/O-Primitivo-Cholesterol.jpg"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;.) &amp;nbsp;No matter what, one of the most basic tenets of modern medicine is to consider the point of the test. &amp;nbsp;If one runs a test, one must be prepared to do something with the information. &amp;nbsp;If you aren't going to do anything about it, then why run the test in the first place? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was pleasantly surprised by a &lt;a href="http://jama.ama-assn.org/content/early/2011/12/14/jama.2011.1916.extract"&gt;&lt;i&gt;JAMA&lt;/i&gt; editorial&lt;/a&gt; from earlier this month concerning these universal recommendations. The new NHLBI guidelines are linked to recommendations about both behavioral and drug therapies. &amp;nbsp;The behavioral therapies are obvious -- increased exercise and a prudent diet (*cough*). &amp;nbsp;And surely we should be recommending a diet focused on healthy, whole foods and avoiding processed foods for everyone. &amp;nbsp;Healthy activity is also a universal and without too much controversy. &amp;nbsp;But then you get to drug therapy for dyslipidemia, which in 2012 means &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2008/jul/09/health.medicalresearch"&gt;statins for kids&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is where the &lt;i&gt;JAMA&lt;/i&gt; editorial gets real. &amp;nbsp;They note that in a meta-analysis of 10 primary prevention trials (primary prevention refers to people without prior cardiovascular disease, more or less the general population, whereas secondary prevention refers to drug treatment of folks who have already had a heart attack or stroke), statin use was associated with a 30% reduction in coronary events and a 12% reduction in total mortality (&lt;a href="http://www.bmj.com/content/338/bmj.b2376.abstract"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;). &amp;nbsp;(Let's ignore the fact that these are relative risk rather than absolute risk numbers for now, more on that later!) &amp;nbsp;Let's not ignore the fact that atherosclerosis begins in childhood, and that cholesterol levels track from childhood to adulthood. &amp;nbsp;Reducing LDL cholesterol levels appears to extend the life of people with familial hypercholesterolemia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But. &amp;nbsp;But but but but but. &amp;nbsp;Even a cardiologist would have to agree that most children with "dyslipidemia" will &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; develop early heart disease. &amp;nbsp;Treating these children with statins exposes them to unwarranted risk and side effects. &amp;nbsp;Drugs that lower cholesterol, such as fibrates, sterols, or the newer &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CETP_inhibitor"&gt;CETP inhibitors&lt;/a&gt;, are only associated with an increased or unchanged risk in cardiovascular events, suggesting that lowering cholesterol numbers itself is not a means to an end. &amp;nbsp;The studies for the first CETP inhibitor, torcetrapib (which does a crackerjack job of lowering LDL and raising HDL at the same time! &amp;nbsp;Whee!) showed a modest increased hazard ratio (only 1.25) which scarily enough would &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; have been detected if only the cholesterol measures were used, rather than overall mortality or cardiovascular events in the initial studies. &amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &lt;i&gt;JAMA&lt;/i&gt; authors go on to remark that statins have been tested in small numbers of children ( a few hundred, for studies ranging from 8 weeks to 2 years) for brief periods of time, and only the surrogate outcomes (cholesterol measures) have been assessed. &amp;nbsp;So far, trials have lacked the size and duration to demonstrate any health benefits for children. &amp;nbsp;If there are long term harms, it is unclear how these might be detected. &amp;nbsp;Surely this uncertainly would be enough to give most pediatricians pause, to say the least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if one screens, there will be a compulsion to act quickly on the results. &amp;nbsp;Do you give statins to children with NO data? &amp;nbsp;Wouldn't you recommend whole foods, avoiding processed garbage and prudent exercise as staples for all children as a matter of course? &amp;nbsp;"What this novel public health intervention in children clearly lacks is an evaluation to determine whether the long-term risk-benefit profile may in fact be favorable or harmful." &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let's move on from children to women, where statin use has also been controversial, as a very new meta-analysis was published in the &lt;i&gt;Journal of the American College of Cardiology&lt;/i&gt; this very week: &amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://content.onlinejacc.org/cgi/content/abstract/59/6/572"&gt;Meta-Analysis of Statin Effects in Women Versus Men&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;I imagine this study will be used in order to further pressure all of us with average cholesterol to go on medicine for primary prevention of heart disease. &amp;nbsp;This meta-analysis (which brings together the data from a number of different studies) strives to do what no statin study has done before--prove any benefit in women, particularly in primary prevention. &amp;nbsp;In the end the authors find in a compilation of data from 18 trials with sex-specific outcomes (141,235 people and 40,275 women) that outcomes were similar for women as for men. &amp;nbsp;That is a statistically significant benefit for women as well as men of similar magnitude in both primary and secondary prevention. &amp;nbsp;All-cause mortality was also lower with statin therapy both in women and in men with no significant differences between the sexes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well. &amp;nbsp;Hallelujah. &amp;nbsp;At last. &amp;nbsp;The conclusion: &amp;nbsp;"Statin therapy should be used in appropriate patients without regard to sex."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, as we all know, the devil is in the details. &amp;nbsp;And in a beautiful editorial in the very same edition of &lt;i&gt;Journal of the American College of Cardiology&lt;/i&gt; we have "&lt;a href="http://content.onlinejacc.org/cgi/content/full/59/6/583"&gt;Controversy and Consensus About Statin Use: &amp;nbsp;It Is Not About the Sex&lt;/a&gt;." The editorial says, yes, indeed, finally, and it is no surprise, that statin therapy should be of similar benefit to women and men, but what does that mean, exactly?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It means, with secondary prevention, those who have already had a heart attack for example, that statins do indeed impart benefit, and I'm willing to extend that benefit to women as well as men. &amp;nbsp;But when we come to primary prevention (statins in people with risk factors for heart disease, not proven heart disease), we are talking a whole different kettle of fish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, of more than 2300 studies identified by the doctors doing the meta-analysis, &lt;i&gt;only 18 &lt;/i&gt;met all the inclusion criteria (meaning they were of high quality enough to be included). &amp;nbsp;8 were primary prevention trials, and 17 were funded by the pharmaceutical industry, and only 2 included sex-specific data on side effects (or "adverse events"). &amp;nbsp;One of the included trials was JUPITER, which remains controversial as it was halted early and had a short follow-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The "devil" here is that women are considerably less likely to die of heart disease than are men. &amp;nbsp;Thus any primary prevention in women will need to meet a more stringent requirement than in men, as by numbers alone primary prevention of heart disease will be of lesser benefit in women. &amp;nbsp;The risks of diabetes, muscle problems, cognitive deficits, and perhaps increase in cancer would be expected to be more of an issue in women, with smaller lean mass thus higher relative statin dose (same issue is at play in children), longer lifespans and lower risk of heart disease and higher risk of cancer than men. &amp;nbsp;While "relative risk" of decrease in heart disease (say a decrease of 2% to 1%, with a relative risk decrease of 100%!) might be promising, the absolute risk (that change from 2 to 1%) is unimportant. &amp;nbsp;So here we get to the heart of the matter:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;Women without CVD have lower annual mortality risk and lower CVD risk than men without CVD. &amp;nbsp;Therefore, the absolute benefit of statins will typically be less for women than men, suggesting it might be appropriate that women receive statins less frequently than men in the setting of primary prevention. The current meta-analysis provides information about sex-specific relative risk benefit and not absolute benefit. &amp;nbsp;Both absolute risk of CVD and the proportionate risk reduction associated with statin therapy are needed to make informed clinical choices with regard to the use of statins for primary prevention. &amp;nbsp;Although the latter might be similar for the sexes, the former might be quite different.&lt;/blockquote&gt;As only 2 studies provided sex-specific risk data, we simply cannot evaluate the risk of statins for primary prevention in women &amp;nbsp;Adverse outcomes are extremely clinically important when we are giving medicines to healthy people to prevent disease. &amp;nbsp;More wisdom from the editorial:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;Sex-specific results in cardiovascular prevention tirals should be provided for relative and absolute benefits, adverse outcomes, and cost-effectiveness. &amp;nbsp;Only then we will know with less uncertainty whether what is good for the gander is also good for the goose. &amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Medicine is still an art&lt;/i&gt;. [emphasis mine]&lt;/blockquote&gt;And, finally, some thoughts on some email conversations I've had with &lt;a href="http://www.archevore.com/"&gt;Kurt Harris&lt;/a&gt; on low dose naltrexone. &amp;nbsp;We were discussing the use of LDN in allergy and autoimmune disease, and I had stumbled upon this skeptical webpost: &amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/index.php/low-dose-naltrexone-bogus-or-cutting-edge-science/"&gt;Low Dose Naltrexone, Bogus or Cutting Edge Science&lt;/a&gt;? &amp;nbsp;The truth is that LDN has shown a robust benefit for a very challenging illness, Crohns Disease, in studies at Penn State (&lt;a href="http://www.lowdosenaltrexone.org/ldn_trials.htm"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;). &amp;nbsp;In these studies, the inexpensive and by any rational observation low risk low-dose naltrexone performed better than the incredibly expensive noxious anti-TNF-alpha Humira. &amp;nbsp;We certainly know much more about Humira's risks-- they are many, and yet it is somehow dangerous and "woo" &amp;nbsp;to recommend a trial of LDN in comparison. LDN has real potential to modify the immune system to decrease deadly and intolerable immune reactions in diseases such as Crohns. &amp;nbsp;Naltrexone has been in use for a decade or more, and while there is a dose-dependent risk of liver damage, that risk tends to happen at 150mg daily. &amp;nbsp;LDN is about 4.5 mg a day. &amp;nbsp;Sure, there is no argument that we should have more data, but how is it crazy and dangerous to recommend LDN for Chrons (as opposed to Humira or even steroids) and not crazy and dangerous to recommend statins for primary prevention, a very accepted practice? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my mind, when we are considering difficult illnesses with only dangerous evidenced-based cures, we have consider common sense and the cost of large trials and the corrupt influence of money and the pharmaceutical industry. &amp;nbsp;One such example is the vitamin supplement &lt;a href="http://evolutionarypsychiatry.blogspot.com/2010/08/circles-of-sam-e.html"&gt;SAMe,&lt;/a&gt; which performed better in trials at MGH than any FDA approved adjunctive treatment for resistant depression. &amp;nbsp;SAMe is not without risks (mania and elevated homocysteine), yet surely Abilify (which has FDA approval), 10X more expensive and with risks of permanent movement disorders, weight gain, metabolic syndrome, and diabetes should sensibly be a second-tier option in resistant depression compared to SAMe, with a decades-long track record of randomized controlled trials? &amp;nbsp; Somehow that is not the case. &amp;nbsp;Somehow we put Abilify ahead of the mere supplement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm preaching to the choir. &amp;nbsp;But I suppose that is what a blog is for. &amp;nbsp;The papers march on, the money, the meta-analyses, the editorials. &amp;nbsp;Does anyone demonstrate common sense in actual clinical practice? &amp;nbsp;We shall have to see. &amp;nbsp;Money (and time?) is running out for us to come to our senses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I read recently &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Cholesterol-Delusion-Ernest-Curtis-M-D/dp/1608449629/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1328294344&amp;amp;sr=8-1"&gt;The Cholesterol Delusion&lt;/a&gt; by Ernest Curtis, M.D., a cardiologist, at the recommendation of Mike Eades. &amp;nbsp;It's a short read, pointed, and interesting. &amp;nbsp;Worth the time. &amp;nbsp;One of his most important points of wisdom is that any study or news report touting relative risk in lieu of absolute risk has an agenda and is trying to make a dramatic statement when there may or may not be any reasonable difference in risk.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3045634714760830992-629135129517439629?l=evolutionarypsychiatry.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>http://evolutionarypsychiatry.blogspot.com/2012/01/medicine-is-still-art.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Emily Deans)</author><thr:total>11</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3045634714760830992.post-3264048548194035224</guid><pubDate>Sat, 28 Jan 2012 21:31:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2012-01-28T16:57:11.433-05:00</atom:updated><title>More Evidence for a Gut-Brain Connection</title><description>Someone (Stephen B) emailed me via Google +, which I didn't know was possible, mostly because I have yet to bother to figure out anything about Google +, mostly because my reading pile is dangerously high and Google+ wasn't very iPad friendly. &amp;nbsp; If I'm going to figure out any new complex system of communication with circles, it had better be with my feet warm and snuggly under the covers, thus iPad friendly. &amp;nbsp;Now you know my opinion, so go work on that, Google.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neon Trees. &amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psdJcrNda84"&gt;Everybody Talks&lt;/a&gt; (right click to open in new tab).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The abstract of the paper Stephan sent me seemed mighty intriguing indeed (pardon the font hiccup here but I am too lazy to type it out rather than cut-n-paste and Blogger is dreadful about editing such things. &amp;nbsp;My, I am certainly opinionated today!). &amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21876150"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 22px;"&gt;Ingestion of &lt;i&gt;Lactobacillus&lt;/i&gt; strain regulates emotional&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 22px;"&gt;behavior and central GABA receptor expression in&amp;nbsp;a mouse via the vagus nerve&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know that title might not make everyone's heart go pitter patter immediately, but it is actually Evolutionary Psychiatry exciting. As I noted in a couple of previous blog posts, it is clear that (in mice, anyway) the wee beasties of the microflora in the gut (comprising about 90% of the cells in our bodies) &lt;a href="http://evolutionarypsychiatry.blogspot.com/2011/07/more-fun-with-gut-microbiota-and-brain.html"&gt;have something to say about behavior and moods&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;In addition, &lt;a href="http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/evolutionary-psychiatry/201111/will-stress-injure-your-gut"&gt;behavior and mood can affect the population of the gut flora&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;But how the communication proceeds is a bit mysterious. &amp;nbsp;Hopefully this paper will shed some light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, a little bit about &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma-Aminobutyric_acid"&gt;GABA&lt;/a&gt;. It is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system (glutamate being the major excitatory neurotransmitter). GABA is a nice glass of wine in front of the fire. &amp;nbsp; GABA is restful sleep. &amp;nbsp;GABA is tranquility and &lt;a href="http://evolutionarypsychiatry.blogspot.com/2010/08/yoga-ba-gaba.html"&gt;yoga&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;Not surprisingly, GABA plays a major role in conditions such as anxiety disorders and irritable bowel syndrome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now let's introduce &lt;i&gt;Lactobacillus rhamnosus&lt;/i&gt;. &amp;nbsp;These little bacteria can modulate the immune system via manipulation of TNF-alpha and IL-8, and can change T cell production. &amp;nbsp;In addition, in rodents, it reduces the autonomic nervous system response to intestinal distention and alters small intestinal motility. &amp;nbsp;That's a lot of long range action for a wee beastie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, for the study, the researchers gave some mice probiotics, and other mice got broth. &amp;nbsp;Then the mice were tortured in various ways to induce a stress response. &amp;nbsp;Some of the mice had surgery to sever the vagus nerve (which is the major communication highway between the gut and the brain). &amp;nbsp;And mice ultimately made the ultimate sacrifice to have GABA levels and mRNA levels measured in the brain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results: &amp;nbsp;mice who go the probiotics were, in general, more chilled out than the control mice. &amp;nbsp;The probiotic mice had lower levels of corticosteroid release in response to stress. &amp;nbsp;Steroids are something the body pumps out as an emergency reaction to stress, and while in the immediate timeframe they can save your life (grandma lifting the car off the toddler, for example), in the long run, chronically elevated stress hormones like steroids can lead to depression, anxiety, heart disease, you name it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mice who had their vagus nerves severed did not differ from the control mice so did not experience the anxiolytic effects of the &lt;i&gt;Lactobacillus&lt;/i&gt; probiotic. &amp;nbsp;This would suggest the communication from the bacteria (&lt;a href="http://evolutionarypsychiatry.blogspot.com/2011/07/groovy-probiotics.html"&gt;via its own neurotransmitters?&lt;/a&gt; or via immune modulation in the gut) definitely goes through the vagus nerve on its way to the brain to control behavior. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, when the brains of the little mice were tested, the amounts of mRNA of various types of GABA receptors (reflecting the amount of messages from the genes to create the GABA receptors) were higher in certain key brain areas of certain key subtypes of GABA receptor. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what does it all mean? Actually, the authors of the study summarize nicely (the "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothalamic%E2%80%93pituitary%E2%80%93adrenal_axis"&gt;HPA axis&lt;/a&gt;" is the connection between the brain and adrenal glands and how corticosteroids are released and regulated, and there is more font hiccuping. Sorry):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;&lt;div style="font: 9.0px Times; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"&gt;Furthermore, in this study we observed that &lt;i&gt;L. rhamnosus&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;administration reduces the stress-induced elevation in corticosterone, suggesting that the impact of the&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Lactobacillus&lt;/i&gt; on the CNS has an important effect at a physiological level. Alterations in the HPA axis have been linked to the development of mood disorders&amp;nbsp;and have been shown to affect the composition of the microbiota in rodents… Moreover, it has been shown that alterations in HPA axis modulation can be reversed by treatment with &lt;i&gt;Lactobacillus&lt;/i&gt; and&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Bifi&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;dobacterium&lt;/i&gt;. However, caution is needed when extrapolating from single timepoint neuroendocrine studies. Nonetheless, these data clearly indicate that in the bidirectional communication between the brain and the gut, the HPA axis is a key component that can be affected by changes in the enteric microbiota.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;So, once again, a common ancestral practice to consume fermented foods rich in probiotics is quite interesting. &amp;nbsp;There is almost no evidence in humans as yet for psychiatric disorders (&lt;a href="http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/evolutionary-psychiatry/201105/the-parasite-ate-your-depression"&gt;the only scientific evidence I'm aware of is discussed in my blog post here&lt;/a&gt;). &amp;nbsp;But all in all the data and research &amp;nbsp;looks to be very interesting, and perhaps promising.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3045634714760830992-3264048548194035224?l=evolutionarypsychiatry.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>http://evolutionarypsychiatry.blogspot.com/2012/01/more-evidence-for-gut-brain-connection.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Emily Deans)</author><thr:total>9</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3045634714760830992.post-26856898493918040</guid><pubDate>Sun, 22 Jan 2012 21:46:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2012-01-28T16:32:10.098-05:00</atom:updated><title>Autism and Antioxidants -- A Wee Little Explanation</title><description>To start off, here is Elvis Presley's last Number 1 hit: &amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0vXxH1IEmQ"&gt;A Little Less Conversation&lt;/a&gt; (right click to open in new tab)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yesterday I put up a little post discussing a &lt;a href="http://evolutionarypsychiatry.blogspot.com/2012/01/tylenol-and-autism.html"&gt;&lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt; theoretical possible link&lt;/a&gt; between acetaminophen and autism. &amp;nbsp;The main point is that acetaminophen is known to gobble up glutathione like gangbusters, and some of us will be more vulnerable to this glutathione destruction than others. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glutathione is a major part of the body's detoxifying systems. &amp;nbsp;When we burn fuel and various other biochemical things, we create &lt;a href="http://www.wisegeek.com/what-are-free-radicals.htm"&gt;toxic byproducts&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;These toxins can damage DNA and make systems inefficient and ragged, and call up our inflammatory army to clear the damage, which can cause its own problems. &amp;nbsp;Since our body is a tiny little ecosystem, we have our own chemical clean-up crew that should be johnny on the spot to sop up free radicals and other untoward elements. &amp;nbsp;We can measure how good our clean-up crew is in various ways, and a couple of very small studies have demonstrated that kids with autism don't seem to be very good at dispensing with toxins. &amp;nbsp;In this Egyptian paper (&lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20845086"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;), kids with autism have lower rates of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superoxide_dismutase"&gt;superoxide dismutase &lt;/a&gt;and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutathione_peroxidase"&gt;glutathione peroxidase &lt;/a&gt;than matched control children (this could mean they make less or are dealing with more oxidation than other kids, so the enzymes are used up faster). &amp;nbsp;These two enzymes clean up superoxide and the resultant hydrogen peroxide, reducing them to less dangerous downstream products. I have also &lt;a href="http://evolutionarypsychiatry.blogspot.com/2010/12/brain-efficiency-pediatric-edition.html"&gt;reviewed a study&lt;/a&gt; showing inefficient and dirty mitochondria in children with autism compared to controls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-iLHl1SpR1Ck/Txx8N6I8ctI/AAAAAAAAAQw/5dVUF9BmPpc/s1600/4537315111_87aaa3b13e.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="320" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-iLHl1SpR1Ck/Txx8N6I8ctI/AAAAAAAAAQw/5dVUF9BmPpc/s320/4537315111_87aaa3b13e.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;A free radical courtesy &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pagedooley/4537315111/sizes/m/in/photostream/"&gt;Flickr Creative Commons&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Children under 3 not only grow at a rapid rate, they also seem to have naturally low glutathione levels, making them among those particularly vulnerable to oxidant injury (&lt;a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cbf.937/abstract"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;). &amp;nbsp;Children who have genetic inefficiency in the antioxidant system will therefore be even more vulnerable. &amp;nbsp;The brain, being a high energy and relatively delicate organ (the liver has an astonishing capacity to regenerate cells, whereas the brain has almost no capacity to regrow cells but can modulate connections to bypass injured systems to some extent) will be especially susceptible to oxidative damage. &amp;nbsp;Another area vulnerable to lack of glutathione? &amp;nbsp;Our delicate airways -- one of the reasons perhaps some children eventually "grow out" of asthma.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guess what else is exceedingly important in establishing an amazing and efficient antioxidant system? &amp;nbsp;That's right. &amp;nbsp;Micronutrient status. &amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v306/n5940/abs/306284a0.html"&gt;Copper and zinc&lt;/a&gt; need to be topped up in order to make plenty of superoxide dismutase, for example.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You know who else tends to have a less efficient antioxidant-making system and lower amounts of glutathione? &amp;nbsp;Yes, the elderly. &amp;nbsp;As I've mentioned in the past, the pathophysiology of autism and dementia seem to have some similarities -- a similar puzzling and devastating process of inflammation and neuronal cell death occurring at entirely different developmental stages. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are all complex processes with many players, internal and external. &amp;nbsp;That's why I don't think there is any "one" cause of the autism spectrum disorders (or the dementias, for that matter). &amp;nbsp;However, combine a genetic vulnerability, low zinc status, maybe some acetaminophen, and inflammatory insult, and ultimately there is a straw that breaks the camel's back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good news is that most of us are resilient and can handle a bit of acetaminophen here and a bit of red #5 there, and some of us sail through life smoking cigarettes and chomping on &lt;a href="http://wwpgh.com/int_port/ffries/"&gt;funky fries&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;The bad news is that some of us aren't as resilient, and one way or another we will all have to pay the piper.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3045634714760830992-26856898493918040?l=evolutionarypsychiatry.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>http://evolutionarypsychiatry.blogspot.com/2012/01/autism-and-antioxidants-wee-little.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Emily Deans)</author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-iLHl1SpR1Ck/Txx8N6I8ctI/AAAAAAAAAQw/5dVUF9BmPpc/s72-c/4537315111_87aaa3b13e.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>8</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3045634714760830992.post-8973547638496776179</guid><pubDate>Sat, 21 Jan 2012 19:47:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2012-01-22T16:48:32.867-05:00</atom:updated><title>Tylenol and Autism?</title><description>I know. &amp;nbsp;The link seems silly. &amp;nbsp;Tylenol is for &lt;a href="http://www.tylenol.com/index.jhtml?utm_source=google&amp;amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;amp;utm_campaign=CT.IT.Peds+-+Infants+-+Branded&amp;amp;utm_term=babies%20tylenol&amp;amp;utm_content=General+-+Info%2FAbout|mkwid|sk1NZUbY4|pcrid|10903926306"&gt;babies, right&lt;/a&gt;? &amp;nbsp;Far &lt;a href="http://www.reyessyndrome.org/aspirin.html"&gt;safer than aspirin for fever&lt;/a&gt;, after all. &amp;nbsp;Pediatricians recommend acetaminophen (tylenol) all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me not mislead you, for everything I am about to write about is tenuous. &amp;nbsp;And yet all doctors will have a wrinkle-nosed reaction to tylenol, simply &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002598.htm"&gt;because if you overdose on the stuff&lt;/a&gt;, even in small amounts, &lt;a href="http://evolutionarypsychiatry.blogspot.com/2011/03/problems-i-have-nac-for-that.html"&gt;you run the risk of dying a horrible death&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;Tylenol breaks down to NAPQI which breaks down the master antioxidant of the body, glutathione, in large amounts, and kills the liver and kidneys and brain. &amp;nbsp;Who cares if it is the liver, which repairs itself at a rapid rate -- what about the lungs? &amp;nbsp;Or the brain? &amp;nbsp;"Real" antioxidants are more than a vitamin pill. &amp;nbsp;We need to &lt;a href="http://thatpaleoguy.com/2011/10/21/antioxidants-make-your-own/"&gt;make our own&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In autism, there is an increased level of inflammation (&lt;a href="http://www.grc.nia.nih.gov/branches/rrb/dna/pubs/Becker%20and%20Schultz%202009.pdf"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;There are an increasing number of reports that anomalies in the immune system may play a role in autism. This has been found at the molecular, pathological, and epidemiological level. Altered lev- els of immunoglobulins, cytokines&lt;span style="color: #051267;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;and inflammatory markers have been identified in the serum,&amp;nbsp;cerebral spinal fluid, and autopsy brain tissues&lt;span style="color: #051267;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;of autistic patients. Gastrointestinal inflammation in autism&lt;span style="color: #051267;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;as well as pathological evidence of neuroinflammation involving activation of brain microglia has been shown. An increase in head circumference in autistic children, a consistent finding in autism, may involve neuroinflammation.&lt;/blockquote&gt;More interesting information (&lt;a href="http://evolutionarypsychiatry.blogspot.com/2011/05/new-studies-nutritional-and-pathologic.html"&gt;and a related blog post from some time ago)&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;Numerous studies have attempted to measure the prevalence of autism and asthma in the population. Both asthma and autism have had a similar apparent rise in the number of cases since approximately 1980, over the past 30 years, and in both disorders these have been repeatedly referred to as ‘‘epidemics”. In autism, this apparent rise in cases is highly controversial &lt;span style="color: #051267;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;and may be whole or in part due to increased disease awareness and/or expansion and reclassification of diagnostic criteria.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;&amp;nbsp;The following discussion is not intended to judge the validity of disease prevalence studies in asthma or autism; it is simply to point out interesting minor anomalies in those curves. In disease prevalence curves of both autism and asthma in the US, the sharp rise in cases began in approximately 1980. In the period from 1980 to 1990 there were two slight downturns in the slope of the curves, after 1982 and after 1986. Both curves continue markedly upward after 1988 into the 1990s. In addition, there are similar slight downturns in slopes of the curves at the same times from independent and geographically disparate studies in both asthma and autism including; asthma hospitalizations, autism cases in Minnesota, autism in north east London,&amp;nbsp;and autism in an urban area in Sweden.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;Four significant events related to acetaminophen use occurred between 1980 and 1990. The first was the CDC caution in 1980 concerning the relationship of aspirin to the risk of Reyes Syndrome which was followed by a public and professional warning by the United States Surgeon General regarding a possible Reyes Syndrome–aspirin association. These cautions against the use of aspirin as a fever reducer in children were largely responsible for the replacement of aspirin by acetaminophen as a pediatric antipyretic&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #051267;"&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;In 1982 and again in 1986 there were product tampering cases where acetaminophen tablets were laced with cyanide resulting in&amp;nbsp;eight deaths. Acetaminophen sales collapsed after each tampering event, but recovered in less than a year in each case. These dates roughly correspond to the slight downturns in asthma and autism cases.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Personally, I do not give my children acetaminophen and I do not take it myself. &amp;nbsp;It should be known that I think fevers come into play for a reason, to kill germs, and I do not administer medicines to my children explicitly for fever control unless the fever is dangerously high, or the children are in pain due to headache or ear infections or whatever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The data I present here is definitely preliminary. &amp;nbsp;The alternatives for fever reduction, aspirin and NSAIDS, all have downsides as well (NSAIDS can cause kidney and gut damage and aspirin can be deadly in children as well). &amp;nbsp;I would just caution parents not to be too free with Tylenol. &amp;nbsp;I know that many parents pre-treat their children prior to immunizations, for example, and I think that is a bad idea. &amp;nbsp;Exercise prudence. &amp;nbsp;That's my message, in a nutshell. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more explanation about autism and antioxidants, please see &lt;a href="http://evolutionarypsychiatry.blogspot.com/2012/01/autism-and-antioxidants-wee-little.html"&gt;my next post&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3045634714760830992-8973547638496776179?l=evolutionarypsychiatry.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>http://evolutionarypsychiatry.blogspot.com/2012/01/tylenol-and-autism.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Emily Deans)</author><thr:total>10</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3045634714760830992.post-5392504097622807683</guid><pubDate>Sun, 15 Jan 2012 21:50:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2012-01-16T21:32:40.475-05:00</atom:updated><title>Diet and ADHD - A Literature Review</title><description>Last Thursday I had to report for jury duty. &amp;nbsp;Fortunately my number was on the higher side, so it involved me sitting in a room for a while reading some papers while the slots for the criminal case were filled. &amp;nbsp;I'm glad I wasn't selected -- the case involved the deaths of small children in a fire. &amp;nbsp;Ever since I had a couple of my own small children, I find it much harder to be "clinical" about violence and death when it comes to kids. &amp;nbsp;I put down &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Blood-Meridian-Evening-Redness-West/dp/0679728759"&gt;Blood Meridian&lt;/a&gt; five years ago and haven't picked it up since. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNc5z2nu4MQ"&gt;Grieg - Holberg Suite (Prelude)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the terrific articles released this month is &lt;a href="http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2012/01/04/peds.2011-2199.abstract"&gt;The Diet Factor in Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;i&gt;Pediatrics&lt;/i&gt;. &amp;nbsp;A couple of neurologists culled the literature, including not only the modern work done in Australia, England, and Belgium, but also the old Feingold stuff from the 70s. &amp;nbsp;They offer both an historical and evidence-based perspective, which enables one to see not only the science, but the human story of dietary treatments for ADHD. &amp;nbsp;Let's dive in, as there is a lot to cover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The paper begins with a brief overview. &amp;nbsp;Basically, when it comes to dietary treatments for ADHD, there isn't that much to choose from that has been studied. &amp;nbsp; We start with the old anti-salycilate &lt;a href="http://www.feingold.org/"&gt;Feingold approach&lt;/a&gt; (which also avoids other major allergens, such as food dyes and other additives.) The diet involves avoiding apples, grapes, lunch meats, and any foods containing artificial preservatives or dyes. &amp;nbsp; One could eat certain cereals, beef, lamb, pineapples, bananas, pears, grapefruit, milk, eggs, and color-free vitamins. &amp;nbsp;Enthusiasm for Feingold was huge in the 1970s, however, clinical trial results weren't as impressive as the case reports. &amp;nbsp;Occasionally, certain children would have an amazing response, but overall the treatment was not helpful to most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After Feingold waxed and waned (20 articles in pubmed between 1979-1988, 2 between 1990-2010), a newer elimination diet approach has come to the fore (based on the Southhampton Study &lt;a href="http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/evolutionary-psychiatry/201106/how-does-diet-affect-symptoms-adhd"&gt;I've written about several times&lt;/a&gt;, with the follow-up INCA study that was quite impressive). &amp;nbsp;The theory behind these diets and Feingold is that ADHD behaviors are, for some, a display of intolerance to certain foods. &amp;nbsp;The Southamption study backed this theory up with some superfly demonstration that the kids who were sensitive to food dyes had histamine systems that seemed to be more brittle and less able to clear out junk than other kids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hypoallergenic diets are a version of your basic "paleo autoimmune" diet - no wheat, cow's milk, cheese, eggs, nuts, chocolate, or citrus fruits. &amp;nbsp;Hypoallergenic foods include lamb, beef, potato, tapioca, carrots, peas, and pears. &amp;nbsp;(Another example is a "few foods elimination diet" consisting of turkey, rice, pear, and lettuce, in which 62% of children had a &amp;gt;50% improvement in behavior on the diet). &amp;nbsp;In pilot studies and the larger INCA trial, these diets typically resulted in significant improvement in 60% of the children who tried them. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem with elimination diets is that they are tough. &amp;nbsp;You have to be very strict, and the whole family has to be on the same page. &amp;nbsp;With&lt;a href="https://licensing.disney.com/Home/display.jsp?contentId=dcp_home_ourbusinesses_food_health_beauty_us&amp;amp;forPrint=false&amp;amp;language=en&amp;amp;preview=false&amp;amp;imageShow=0&amp;amp;pressRoom=US&amp;amp;translationOf=null&amp;amp;region=0"&gt; every Disney character advertising a new processed food &lt;/a&gt;these days, it is harder than you think to keep the kids' diet clean even for a short duration of an elimination diet trial. &amp;nbsp;I know when I show up at snack time at the preschool, most of the kids have spritely-colored gogurt and goldfish and juice boxes. &amp;nbsp; My poor children (who don't seem to have behavioral or attentional problems) are stuck with water, prissy whole milk straight from the dairy delivered in glass bottles, fruits, meats, home fries, mashed potatoes, stew, veggies, and if they are lucky, the occasional organic pudding, yobaby full fat yogurt, or gluten-free pretzels. &amp;nbsp;Frankly, the only way I get them to eat mostly healthy is by stuffing them full of good stuff first and bribing them with a small amount of bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT, considering that such diets, when done with care, are a relatively harmless maneuver, it seems worth trying. And considering that most of the moms I know seem to have at least one son with some real attention-related issues, I wish there were more public support for these diets. &amp;nbsp;One mustn't have the expectation that the diets are a cure all, however. &amp;nbsp;Typically, 40% of kids will not respond. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eo27diVvguw&amp;amp;feature=related"&gt;Grieg - Holberg Suite (Air)&lt;/a&gt; - Right click to open in new tab. &amp;nbsp;I do like this piece. &amp;nbsp;One of my all time favorites. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides elimination diets, supplements with iron, zinc, and omega 3 fatty acids have also been attempted in the treatment of ADHD. &amp;nbsp;Long chain omega 3 PUFAs are lower in the RBC membranes of kids with ADHD compared to controls. &amp;nbsp;Kids with ADHD may have low O3 intake as well as reduced conversion of other long chain PUFAs to the essential O3s. &amp;nbsp;In the Oxford-Durham study, kids with coordination problems were given supplements made of 80/20 O3/O6. &amp;nbsp;ADHD symptoms improved in most of the kids, whereas no change was found in the placebo group. &amp;nbsp;Spelling and reading gains were also substantial in the experimental group over the 3-6 month follow up. &amp;nbsp;There were no adverse effects. &amp;nbsp;These authors, reviewing the 16 studies over the years, recommend doses of 300-600mg daily of Omega 3 with no more than 30-60mg O6 in the supplements (nordic fishes chews, &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Nordic-Naturals-Omega-3-Gummies-chew/dp/B003IGB6R4"&gt;nordic gummy bears&lt;/a&gt;, megared krill oil, and nature made were some examples of supplements used.) The authors note that in their clinic, most parents are enthusiastic about using omega 3 supplementation, but in almost all cases, additional medication treatment is required for meaningful symptom improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zinc! &amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://evolutionarypsychiatry.blogspot.com/2010/07/zinc.html"&gt;I like zinc&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;And in studies in Turkey and the Middle East, kids with zinc deficiency tend to be more hyperactive. &amp;nbsp;These regions have endemic zinc deficiency, unlike the West in general. &amp;nbsp;In a few US studies, zinc supplementation enhanced the benefit from d-amphetamine medicine. &amp;nbsp;The optimal dose of stimulant was decreased by 30% when compared to placebo. Since zinc is a cofactor for the metabolism of many neurotransmitters and fatty acids, it would make sense that having zinc stores tip top would help in ADHD. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Iron - kids with documented iron deficiency or low ferritin do seem to have more problems with learning disorders and cognitive function (yes, your brain needs oxygen!), however, in a random sampling of kids with ADHD, ferritin and iron was no different than those of controls. &amp;nbsp;It makes sense to check for iron deficiency in kids with ADHD, nevertheless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ketogenic diets have not been studied in ADHD, though in kids with epilepsy, attentional and behavioral problems often improve on the ketogenic diet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally - sugar. &amp;nbsp;Despite the sworn testimony of every parent and pre-school teacher everywhere, sugar has never been consistently shown to increase aggression or activity in children compared to placebo, aspartame, or saccharine. &amp;nbsp;However, there is some data to suggest a cranky downward hypoglycemic response in some sensitive children. &amp;nbsp;And while adults don't tend to show behavior symptoms at a blood sugar greater than 54, children consistently show changes on EEG and in behavior at blood sugar levels less than 75 mg/dl. &amp;nbsp;Such a level is easily obtained by giving kids sugar only, while protein and fat can smooth the sugar spike and hypoglycemic aftermath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR3N1yBEGbw&amp;amp;feature=related"&gt;Grieg - Solveig's Song&lt;/a&gt; (also very pretty).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And finally, the authors of the paper give a shout-out to the Australian study showing a link between &lt;a href="http://evolutionarypsychiatry.blogspot.com/2010/08/western-diet-and-adhd.html"&gt;Western Diet and ADHD symptoms&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;The diet pattern had a higher intake of "total fat, saturated fat, refined sugars, and sodium, and is deficient in omega 3 fatty acids, fiber, and folate." &amp;nbsp;The "Healthy diet pattern... is rich in fish, vegetables, fruit, legumes, and whole-grain foods." &amp;nbsp;Of course, a family eating ho-hos, icing, and cotton candy is going to be a different sort of family than the one who eats whole grains and fish. &amp;nbsp;However, I'm all in favor of reducing processed foods. &amp;nbsp;Duh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And that wraps up the summary of the study of dietary factors and ADHD. &amp;nbsp;GAPS was not mentioned. &amp;nbsp;In general, I would say, avoid additives and processed food, make sure your kids are stocked up with minerals, and don't go nuts with the sugar. &amp;nbsp;Elimination diets to determine special food sensitivities or gut bacterial overgrowth problems would probably be more helpful than harmful. &amp;nbsp;Pick your battles, but good food is a worthy fight, I would say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(A sublime soprano version of Solveig's song by Marita Solberg can be found &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G7CyUlEe9QI&amp;amp;feature=related"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;Chills. &amp;nbsp;And I'm a much bigger fan of orchestral music than opera.)&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3045634714760830992-5392504097622807683?l=evolutionarypsychiatry.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>http://evolutionarypsychiatry.blogspot.com/2012/01/diet-and-adhd-literature-review.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Emily Deans)</author><thr:total>13</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3045634714760830992.post-1340129983628659027</guid><pubDate>Thu, 12 Jan 2012 18:35:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2012-01-12T13:35:58.681-05:00</atom:updated><title>Just Eat Fish</title><description>I've covered the importance of omega 3 fatty acids in the brain &lt;a href="http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/evolutionary-psychiatry/201103/your-brain-omega-3"&gt;a number of times&lt;/a&gt;. However, when anyone asks me for specific recommendations, I've had to be distressingly vague. &amp;nbsp;Typically I hem and haw and suggest that someone try to eat plenty of clean cold water marine fish, but if one wants to supplement, it's likely that a mix of EPA/DHA is better than DHA alone despite the fact that DHA is by far the major omega 3 in the brain. &amp;nbsp;But how much do we supplement? &amp;nbsp;Who knows? &amp;nbsp;See, the literature on fish oil supplementation is such a mish-mash of different doses and results than one would have to dedicate a zillion hours scanning through the literature, and frankly, there are better things to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-cE08GXwea8M/Tw8b928exeI/AAAAAAAAAQc/qf5TJtsQo4k/s1600/Y74-26+The+kids+trout+1978+at+THill.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="261" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-cE08GXwea8M/Tw8b928exeI/AAAAAAAAAQc/qf5TJtsQo4k/s400/Y74-26+The+kids+trout+1978+at+THill.jpg" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Warning, fishing at a young age may lead to future moralizing on the internet&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;But this month we are in luck! &amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21939614"&gt;This paper&lt;/a&gt; was published in &lt;i&gt;The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry&lt;/i&gt;, and it sheds a lot of light on the mysteries of fish oil supplementation and what is known about the efficacy when it comes to mental health. &amp;nbsp;I love it when academics comb the literature so I don't have to.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The paper is a meta-analysis of fish oil supplementation trials in depression. &amp;nbsp;There were straight up placebo controlled trials, trials of depression in Parkinson's, in pregnancy… the trials were many, and the results all over the place. &amp;nbsp;This meta-analysis paper like any decent one is fairly excruciating to read. &amp;nbsp; See, you have to take all the results and torture them with statistics until they reveal their secrets. &amp;nbsp;There are statistics for the different types of data, for the particular hypothesis you are attempting to disprove in relation to the data, for the fact that a single author of multiple papers on the same subject will likely have an "author bias" … it's a mess. &amp;nbsp;And with all that data and that torturing who knows what you have on the other side of the computation?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Well, a few findings keep popping up, and you can likely hang your hat on them:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;1) High dose EPA alone is no good.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;2) Any dose of DHA alone is lousy, and may even be harmful.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;3) A fish oil supplement worth its salt for depression symptoms, anyway has at least 60% EPA, and EPA may be the most helpful of the two components. &amp;nbsp;Fortunately, fish and mollusks and whatnot come supplied with fish oil in ratios of EPA higher than DHA, so it does not surprise me that our brains are optimized to run on a mix and not &lt;a href="http://vegetarianstar.com/2010/06/28/dr-oz-recommends-sustainable-algae-dha-as-brain-booster/"&gt;weird, farmed vegan algae DHA&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;(sustainable though it may be). &amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I KNOW. &amp;nbsp;There is hardly any EPA in the brain. &amp;nbsp;HOW CAN THIS BE?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Well, the authors conclude that EPA is the active component, stating that low dose EPA has been shown to be effective, and that it may be that EPA and DHA fight 1:1 for receptors, so in the mixed supplements, the EPA in excess of the DHA is the actual active ingredient. &amp;nbsp; Like most supplements (or anything, really), too high or too low is bad, so high dose EPA on its own passes some sort of goodness threshold on a U-curve and ceases to be healthful. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Interesting item number 1: &amp;nbsp;The effect of dietary DHA supplementation on human brain levels &lt;i&gt;has not been studied&lt;/i&gt;. &amp;nbsp;That's right. &amp;nbsp;It's entirely possible that dietary DHA might not lead to increases in cerebral DHA. &amp;nbsp;If one &lt;i&gt;injects&lt;/i&gt; radiolabeled DHA into healthy humans, however, it is incorporated into the brain at an extremely slow rate (about 3.8 mg/day), with total brain turnover occurring after 2.5 years. &amp;nbsp;Guess how many randomized controlled fish oil trials lasted 2.5 years? (The fifteen trials included in this meta-analysis lasted from 4-16 weeks).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Interesting item number 2: &amp;nbsp;EPA is a precursor for DHA. &amp;nbsp;Given that fish sources tend to have more EPA than DHA, it could be that we are optimized to use the dietary EPA to make the DHA in such a way that it is incorporated into our brains. &amp;nbsp;(A bit of cloudy weather for this interesting item: &amp;nbsp;There have been studies of dietary EPA in humans and rats and it has not been shown to increase plasma or RBC DHA in humans or brain DHA in rats.)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Interesting item number 3: &amp;nbsp;EPA does enter the brain. &amp;nbsp;A tiny bit. &amp;nbsp;The ratio of EPA:DHA in the brain is actually 1:274. &amp;nbsp;And brain EPA in rat studies has been shown to help with neurogeneration and neuroprotection. &amp;nbsp;EPA for 9 months in a human case study study in brain atrophy seemed to increase the ratio of neurogenerative factors in the brain.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Interesting item number 4: EPA's effects could be in the body and these effects secondarily influence the brain. &amp;nbsp;EPA/arachidonic acid ratios seem to effect membrane fluidity, and EPA seems to increase the burning of polyunsaturated fatty acids which will produce ketone bodies. &amp;nbsp;And we all know that &lt;a href="http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/evolutionary-psychiatry/201104/your-brain-ketones"&gt;our brains love ketones&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Interesting item number 5: &amp;nbsp;In trials of DHA alone, the DHA takers tended to do worse than placebo and it might actually lead to a pro-inflammatory environment.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;So what is the dose? &amp;nbsp;All positive trials in the literature had a dose of EPA between 200-2200mg daily (with one lonely successful trial at 4000 mg/d). &amp;nbsp;In the trials with a mixed supplement of DHA and EPA, when you subtract the DHA from the EPA, the dose was also between 200-2200 mg. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;What do I make of it?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://worldofbiochemistry.blogspot.com/2011/07/more-complete-metabolic-map-that-i-know.html"&gt;Here's a diagram of our metabolism&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Yes, it's complicated. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Sometimes the best generalized advice is to keep things simple.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-oTGPjOM0fOw/Tw8n2B7CGkI/AAAAAAAAAQk/m59qzE65hjs/s1600/Y74-27+Christine+cleaning+those+trout+while+Emily+watches.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="260" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-oTGPjOM0fOw/Tw8n2B7CGkI/AAAAAAAAAQk/m59qzE65hjs/s400/Y74-27+Christine+cleaning+those+trout+while+Emily+watches.jpg" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3045634714760830992-1340129983628659027?l=evolutionarypsychiatry.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>http://evolutionarypsychiatry.blogspot.com/2012/01/just-eat-fish.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Emily Deans)</author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-cE08GXwea8M/Tw8b928exeI/AAAAAAAAAQc/qf5TJtsQo4k/s72-c/Y74-26+The+kids+trout+1978+at+THill.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>27</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3045634714760830992.post-853401503425714025</guid><pubDate>Sat, 07 Jan 2012 21:05:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2012-01-07T16:05:23.077-05:00</atom:updated><title>New Study on Vitamin D and Depression</title><description>Quite a bit of feedback on my &lt;a href="http://evolutionarypsychiatry.blogspot.com/2012/01/glorious-cause.html"&gt;rant from yesterday&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;In truth I would probably keep these rants to myself, except I keep getting asked about what I think about certain matters, so I'm assuming there is wider interest in these opinions. &amp;nbsp;The rants garner big audiences, for what it is worth. &amp;nbsp;If you don't like them but enjoy the more sciencey stuff, you can stick to my &lt;a href="http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/evolutionary-psychiatry"&gt;Psychology Today blog&lt;/a&gt;, as I doubt the rants will get cross-posted over there. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To answer and clarify some general questions from the comments: (Sleeper Agent &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Reu8S3YOHXU"&gt;Get Burned&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm not expecting to rain on anyone's parade. &amp;nbsp;There is an inevitable pull to the side of quasi-scientific posturing in the paleosphere. &amp;nbsp;Sometimes I just like to yank back. &amp;nbsp;The even-tempered bloggers (Paul Jaminet and Stephan Guyenet) have large blogrolls. &amp;nbsp;I do not. &amp;nbsp;Like Kurt Harris, I'm a bit more on the cranky side, and I consider my blogroll to be something of an endorsement, meaning I often find valuable information and interesting ideas on those blogs without a huge amount of garbage. &amp;nbsp;Of course nearly all of those on the blogroll have published something I vehemently disagreed with. &amp;nbsp;That's pretty cool, of course. &amp;nbsp;Differing opinions open the mind. &amp;nbsp;When it goes too far into the land of obvious pseudoscience and woo or dangerous advice or the endorsement of that, it is no longer my cup of tea, and I drop the blog. &amp;nbsp;I've dropped several blogs in the past but I just haven't mentioned it. &amp;nbsp;Sometimes, though, not mentioning or pointing out something is taken as tacit approval.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As to Gary Taubes' petition, I merely have a problem with the very specific nature of the treatise. He basically asks us to sign a petition endorsing his particular theory of obesity, which involves insulin and the adipose tissue as the main regulating mechanism. &amp;nbsp;It should be obvious to anyone reading my blog that I don't agree with that theory and feel it has been disproven. &amp;nbsp;That doesn't mean I don't think insulin is involved, or that low carb diets aren't helpful, or that I'm eating a 90% carb diet of unsalted potatoes. &amp;nbsp;I just wish Gary had been a tad less specific - more of a "let's study low carb diets and not be afraid of fat" petition, and "let's not give up on obesity just because most people fail at diets." &amp;nbsp;I'm 100% in favor of not giving up on obesity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As to supplements, I take some myself and have written extensively about them. &amp;nbsp;However, I don't think they are the be-all, cure-all, and used pharmacologically, a risk-benefit analysis ought to be taken, though the full data will never be known. &amp;nbsp;In addition, supplements won't cure a crappy diet, crappy sleep hygiene, and complete other lack of self-care or stress reduction. &amp;nbsp;I like &lt;a href="http://www.stumptuous.com/fuck-supplements"&gt;Stumptuous' rant&lt;/a&gt; for that reason. &amp;nbsp;It's a step back. &amp;nbsp;Let's evaluate as best we can the safety and efficacy, and more often than not the shiny new supplement with the promising data becomes the harmful supplement when more data is gathered. &amp;nbsp; The same is true for prescription pharmaceuticals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of supplements, vitamin D is a tricky one. &amp;nbsp;It was the paleosphere darling for a while. &amp;nbsp;The unheralded sunshine vitamin the dermatologists wanted to take from us with their creams and sun hats. &amp;nbsp;And while getting a certain amount of D to keep from being deficient is clearly helpful, and it seems there is decent data to show that "deficient" for the IOM may be too low when one considers cancer data and being prudent, &amp;nbsp;it is also clearly problematic to go for the gold and have the highest vitamin D level around (not that anyone recommends that). &amp;nbsp;In the past year or so, the promising pro-Vitamin D papers have been followed by some disappointing findings. &amp;nbsp;Some very thoughtful editorials have been written in &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://jama.ama-assn.org/content/305/24/2565.extract"&gt;JAMA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/news/2011/110706/full/475023a.html?s=news_rss"&gt;Nature&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt; on the subject (not even by dermatologists). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've posted on vitamin D and depression before (&lt;a href="http://evolutionarypsychiatry.blogspot.com/2010/07/d-d-depression.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://evolutionarypsychiatry.blogspot.com/2011/04/standing-on-sun-will-not-prevent.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). &amp;nbsp;It seemed very promising when I read the articles at the &lt;a href="http://www.vitamindcouncil.org/health-conditions/mental-health-and-learning-disorders/depression/"&gt;Vitamin D Council&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;But when I looked up the actual scientific studies, there wasn't much at all. &amp;nbsp;I could honestly pull together a sober recommendation that there are plausible reasons to think D levels would effect mood, and since it also plausibly could prevent cancer and help bones, seems reasonable to stay in a nice healthy range. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But of course, I keep an eye out. &amp;nbsp;And this week on twitter a new paper came to my attention from my own alma mater (&lt;a href="http://www.mayoclinicproceedings.com/content/86/11/1050.abstract"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;). &amp;nbsp;This paper is a population study of vitamin D levels and depression scores. &amp;nbsp;5 previous population studies have been done, with 3 showing correlations between low levels and depression, and two showing no correlation. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I've explained before, the brain needs vitamin D for neuronal repair. &amp;nbsp;As depressive disorders can be progressively neurodegenerative, in a similar way but with far less global neuron damage as dementia, it is very plausible that low vitamin D levels could hasten or worsen an existing depression, or perhaps even cause depressive symptoms. &amp;nbsp;Indeed, low levels of vitamin D have been associated with increased inflammatory markers, and inflammation is associated with depression.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The current study is the largest population-based study to date, of 12,600 some odd relatively healthy patients at the &lt;a href="http://www.cooperaerobics.com/For-Individuals/Preventive-Medical-Services/Clinic-Services.aspx"&gt;Cooper Clinic&lt;/a&gt; in sunny Dallas, Texas between 2006 and 2010. &amp;nbsp;The sample was 68% men with a mean age of 52. &amp;nbsp;All participants had baseline 25 (OH) vitamin D (actually D2+D3, though D2 levels are typically negligible in my experience unless someone is taking a prescribed D2 supplement) and had level of depression tested with a standard 10 item questionnaire. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Patients with a history of depression were analyzed separately. &amp;nbsp;There were significantly more women in that group, as well as a significantly higher number of people with history of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. &amp;nbsp;Those with a history of depression had a lower education level, were less likely to exercise, and had a higher BMI. &amp;nbsp;Age, smoking history, and vitamin D levels were &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; significantly different in the patients with a history of depression compared to those without. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Among these 12,600 folks, low vitamin D (less than 20 ng/ml) was very common - 50.7% of the sample was affected. &amp;nbsp;Those who exercised regularly were much more likely to have normal vitamin D levels than those who did not. &amp;nbsp;Those with high levels of vitamin D were significantly less likely to have &lt;i&gt;current&lt;/i&gt; depression symptoms than those who had deficient vitamin D. &amp;nbsp;The effect was stronger in the group with prior history of depression, and was also stronger in October to March than in the sunnier times of the year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The study was limited by the observational nature and the relatively brief screening tool used to diagnose depressive symptoms. &amp;nbsp;But the findings are interesting, and certainly it is still reasonable not to be deficient in Vitamin D, whether you are depressed or not.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3045634714760830992-853401503425714025?l=evolutionarypsychiatry.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>http://evolutionarypsychiatry.blogspot.com/2012/01/new-study-on-vitamin-d-and-depression.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Emily Deans)</author><thr:total>21</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3045634714760830992.post-6304001338302711269</guid><pubDate>Fri, 06 Jan 2012 21:14:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2012-01-09T21:07:24.202-05:00</atom:updated><title>The Glorious Cause</title><description>Evolutionary medicine is important. &amp;nbsp;A common sense, evolutionary based approach to general preventative health care and diet advice &amp;nbsp;could possibly prevent your obese, demented and expensive nursing-home future, change the debt burden, create a healthy, productive, and prosperous individual subset amongst the oppressive planetary burden of 7 billion agricultural-dependent humans. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stakes are high. &amp;nbsp;The adversaries (conventional wisdom and conventional commodities) well-funded and more or less articulate. &amp;nbsp;The doctors in the trenches are gun shy but pressured to adhere to "evidence-based medicine." &amp;nbsp;And by pressured, I mean, will be sued or not meet some evidenced-based "standard care marker" (such as a certain percentage of folks with high cholesterol taking statins) and will make less $$ if they don't adhere to "standard of care." &amp;nbsp;By gun-shy, I mean they were excited by vitamin E. &amp;nbsp; They were excited by B vitamins lowering homocysteine. &amp;nbsp;Then it turns out that vitamin E made everything worse. &amp;nbsp;Lowering homocysteine didn't prevent heart problems. &amp;nbsp;Chromium maybe hurts the liver. &amp;nbsp;The glorious Stumptuous put it best in her blog post - "&lt;a href="http://www.stumptuous.com/fuck-supplements"&gt;F%^$ supplements.&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you think you will make your primary care physician happy by showing up with a list of non-standard labs to be checked and some half-baked theories as to why they are important, you are going to be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Music: &amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-rgIPIkCl4&amp;amp;ob=av3e"&gt;Never Miss A Beat &lt;/a&gt;by the Kaiser Chiefs (right click in new tab, sorry about the ads!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doctors are conservative because we have to be conservative. &amp;nbsp;We are the last bastion of sense against shark cartilage injections and &lt;a href="http://www.consumeraffairs.com/health/trudeau_defenders.html"&gt;calcium as the cure for everything&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;If you want to shoot across the bow of conventional wisdom, you need some hard core rigorous evidence and medicine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gary Taubes sent me (and many, many others) an email &lt;a href="http://www.ipetitions.com/petition/response-to-nytimes-the-fat-trap/"&gt;for a petition&lt;/a&gt; in support of insulin and hormonal fat regulation at the level of the adipocyte being the cause of obesity. &amp;nbsp;He wrote the petition in repsonse to &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/01/magazine/tara-parker-pope-fat-trap.html?_r=1&amp;amp;pagewanted=all"&gt;Tara Pope's article&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;about the difficulties maintaining fat loss after an initial bout of obesity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gary, I'm all for eating well as a long-term cure for obesity, but I'm not going to sign something blaming insulin alone. I can't do it. &amp;nbsp;There's &lt;a href="http://wholehealthsource.blogspot.com/2011/11/brief-response-to-taubess-food-rewad.html"&gt;too much evidence against it&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp; And I'm not sure I buy the "lean mass protection" gig &lt;a href="http://perfecthealthdiet.com/?p=5387"&gt;Paul Jaminet endorses&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;Why so many thin people with vitamin deficiencies, after all? &amp;nbsp;And I'm not going to sign up for the &lt;a href="http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/what-should-you-eat/pyramid/"&gt;Harvard School of Public Health omega 6 fest of a food plate&lt;/a&gt;, either. &amp;nbsp;Epidemiology be dammed. &amp;nbsp;Show me the coronary arteries. &amp;nbsp;Hard evidence for such a departure from the ancestral norms of low omega 6. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And yes, I removed Perfect Health Diet from the "Of Like Minds" list at the right &amp;nbsp;(probably temporarily - depends on my mood) after one too many posts praising Dr. Mercola. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can't do it. &amp;nbsp;I can't have my blog linking to direct endorsements of &lt;a href="http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2011-04-25/health/ct-met-fda-warns-mercola-20110425_1_warning-letter-thermography-fda-crackdown"&gt;frauds&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp; Paul isn't an MD and is not in clinical practice. &amp;nbsp;He can give clinical advice on his blog whereas I, as an MD, cannot due to ethical and legal obligations. &amp;nbsp;He can feel free to consider the fringe of alternative medicine "on the same team" whereas I cannot. &amp;nbsp;I can't be on the same time as quackery because I am one phone call away from the front lines of the gun-shy primary care doctors. &amp;nbsp;I think Paul and Shou-Ching are amazing and thoughtful, but they never went through the humbling experience of clinical medicine training. &amp;nbsp;As many times as we are right, we are wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when Mat Lalonde &lt;a href="http://vimeo.com/27570335"&gt;gives a talk endorsing real science and hard evidence&lt;/a&gt; as a basis for Ancestral Health, I am in complete agreement (&lt;a href="http://evolutionarypsychiatry.blogspot.com/2011/08/ancestral-health-symposium.html"&gt;more or less&lt;/a&gt;). &amp;nbsp;I understand &lt;a href="http://evolvify.com/mat-lalonde-paleo-bloggers-science/"&gt;Andrew's reticence&lt;/a&gt; for the general population of folks and bloggers, but those who find "paleo" and have improvement will build it and spread the word on their own amongst their friends. &amp;nbsp;The real inertia to be lifted is with the primary care doctors and the incentives to keep pumping our processed food and vegetable oils. &amp;nbsp;No amount of enthusiasm and &lt;a href="http://evolutionarypsychiatry.blogspot.com/2011/10/slam-dunked-and-wheat-belly.html"&gt;crappy anti-wheat polemics&lt;/a&gt; will change that. &amp;nbsp;Primary care doctors aren't stupid. &amp;nbsp;They need good evidence to turn the tide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is the sordid truth - conventional wisdom is not wrong. &amp;nbsp;It is only skewed in favor of the vested interests. Cardiovascular disease has been dropping with the advent of the vegetable oil. &amp;nbsp;We have to get people caring about obesity, autoimmune disease, and mental health but the funding is problematic, to say the least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once doctors such as myself are linked with the lunatic fringe, we are done for. &amp;nbsp;Credibility, critical thinking, and scientific evidence are harsh mistresses. &amp;nbsp;I can have my little mistakes, but if I post anything showing major fallacies of critical thinking, I'm done for. &amp;nbsp;As it should be. &amp;nbsp;I'm a Harvard-trained physician, after all. &amp;nbsp;There are certain expectations, even in my hobby of a blog.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'll try not to be blinded by science. &amp;nbsp;I'm not going to praise paleo for the sake of paleo (eat a g$$d%#@^ed banana already, and I don't have time to hunt and kill a boar). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let's not throw the baby out with the bathwater. &amp;nbsp;Life is good and only getting better without the processed food, without the seed oils. &amp;nbsp;Let's protect it, nurture it, and not shove it out into the rocky shoals of the lunatic fringe too soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Glorious-Cause-American-Revolution-1763-1789/dp/019531588X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1325884441&amp;amp;sr=8-1"&gt; The Glorious Cause&lt;/a&gt; is an excellent history of the American Revolution. &amp;nbsp;I highly recommend it.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3045634714760830992-6304001338302711269?l=evolutionarypsychiatry.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>http://evolutionarypsychiatry.blogspot.com/2012/01/glorious-cause.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Emily Deans)</author><thr:total>101</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3045634714760830992.post-4817939277662649216</guid><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2012 20:47:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2012-01-01T15:47:34.768-05:00</atom:updated><title>More on Diet and Dementia</title><description>Thanks to Oregon, another &lt;a href="http://www.neurology.org/content/early/2011/12/28/WNL.0b013e3182436598"&gt;diet and dementia study&lt;/a&gt; hit the press (or internet-prior-to) last week. &amp;nbsp;A modest number of seniors were tested for levels of all sorts of vitamins and fatty acids, given cognitive testing, and then some had MRIs as well. &amp;nbsp;The punch line is that those seniors with the highest levels of B vitamins (B1, B2, B6, B12, and folate) and vitamins C, D, and E had the best scores on cognitive function and some mighty fine lookin' brains. &amp;nbsp;Those with high omega3 marine fatty acids also did well. &amp;nbsp;The cohort with high trans fats did poorly. &amp;nbsp;Exactly what we might expect! &amp;nbsp;Imagine that. &amp;nbsp;What we eat might impact the brain after all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seniors tested were all white, educated Oregonians who joined an aging cohort study back in 1989. &amp;nbsp;293 healthy older folks agreed to be poked, prodded, questioned, imaged, and measured until their deaths. &amp;nbsp;At the time of this study, circa 2006, 104 subjects were left, with an average age of 82, 62% female. &amp;nbsp;The population was originally chosen to be healthy, and after 16 years those that remained were pretty healthy, with a relatively low amount of comorbid illness such as high blood pressure. &amp;nbsp;Only 10% were ApoE4 carriers. Only 7% had B12 deficiency (&amp;lt;200 pg/ml) and 25% were 25 (OH) vitamin D deficient (&amp;lt;20 ng/ml) - meaning that as a whole, the population was pretty well stocked up on vitamins. &amp;nbsp;Eating well is exactly what I would expect from&lt;a href="http://www.ifc.com/shows/portlandia"&gt; a bunch of older, educated Oregonians&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The weaknesses of the study are the small number and the lack of ethnic or socioeconomic diversity and the observational nature. &amp;nbsp;The strength is that multiple nutrients were measured via blood tests rather than relying on the more classic (and classically unreliable) food frequency questionnaires (FFQs). &amp;nbsp;The multiple nutrients were then statistically arranged into certain nutrient patterns - on one hand, this makes it easier to apply the results to real life diets, as people eat food, not isolated nutrients. &amp;nbsp;On the other hand, this type of statistical manipulation can lend itself to data mining.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With imaging, various memory and cognitive tests, 30 plasma biomarkers and 8 biomarker patterns (for example, the B, C, D, E vitamins, marine omega3s, omega6 + retinol, lutein + HDL, saturated fat, trans fat (mostly&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linoelaidic_acid"&gt;&amp;nbsp;linolelaidic acid&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;(18:2omega6t)), carotenoids, etc.) there were quite a lot of associations to be had. &amp;nbsp;The most interesting are the previously mentioned generally better global findings in the BCDE group and the omega3 group, and the generally worse findings in the trans fat group. &amp;nbsp;In addition, folks in the lutein-HDL group had better memory, and those in the omega6 + retinol group had poorer memory and language scores. &amp;nbsp;In adjusting for comorbid factors, age, education, gender, APOE4 status, and other health factors didn't seem to impact these findings that much. &amp;nbsp;The only major link between health problems and nutrients was a link between hypertension and trans fats and low B vitamins, which makes physiologic sense (remember, &lt;a href="http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/evolutionary-psychiatry/201109/are-obesity-diabetes-and-serious-mental-illness-related"&gt;lousy B vitamin status leads to high homocysteine&lt;/a&gt;, which is likely a cause of hypertension).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Interestingly, if the study subject had depression, the link between omega3 status and white matter density in the brain was lost. &amp;nbsp;In subjects without depression, there was a significant link between omega3 levels and a healthier white matter density compared to whole brain volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when the researchers broke it all down, they found that age, gender, APOE4 status, education years, hypertension and depression accounted for 46% of the variation in cognitive scores, and the nutrient status was responsible for an additional 17%. &amp;nbsp;They found nutrient status to account for 37% of the total brain volume and 9% of the white matter density compared to whole brain volume variation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What, then, would constitute the supposed diet of the healthiest brains? &amp;nbsp;Dark leafy green and cruciferous vegetables, fruits, and fish were on the good side, bakery foods such as cookies, pies, doughnuts, fried foods, margarine, red meat, and offal were on the "trans fat" side. &amp;nbsp;(Red meat and offal seemed to be added to this group due to the &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20385883"&gt;previous dietary pattern study done&lt;/a&gt; in Manhattan implicating offal consumption in worsening cognitive status. &amp;nbsp;Chris Masterjohn had something to say about that study &lt;a href="http://www.westonaprice.org/blogs/cmasterjohn/2010/08/15/reductionism-and-holism-go-hand-in-hand/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;"When holism goes horribly wrong -- the perils of dietary pattern analysis" will give you a clue as to his thoughts!) &amp;nbsp;There are, indeed, &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20219966"&gt;trans fats in red meat and offal, but they tend to be CLA&lt;/a&gt;:&amp;nbsp;the 18:2 isomers implicated in this newest study are the baked goods/margarine variety of trans fats. &amp;nbsp;As you know, red meat and offal are fantastic sources of B vitamins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mechanisms by which the specific nutrients may be helpful or harmful are ones we have discussed many times on this blog. &amp;nbsp;The B vitamins are necessary for proper functioning of the folate cycle, which has all sorts of downstream effects with relation to neurotransmitters, oxidative stress, inflammation, etc. &amp;nbsp;I've also discussed &lt;a href="http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/evolutionary-psychiatry/201104/autism-and-vitamin-d"&gt;vitamin D&lt;/a&gt; a number of times, and while I haven't covered much on vitamin E or C, I suppose I should get to that. &amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/evolutionary-psychiatry/201103/your-brain-omega-3"&gt;Omega3s have also been reviewed at length&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trans fats, on the other hand, may well replace omega3s in the cell membranes, and are associated with systemic inflammation, cardiovascular disease, and endothelial dysfunction. &amp;nbsp;All those processes could have an impact on memory, brain structure, and cognition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To break it down, eat "real food," not cookies and doughnuts. &amp;nbsp;How hard is that?&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3045634714760830992-4817939277662649216?l=evolutionarypsychiatry.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>http://evolutionarypsychiatry.blogspot.com/2012/01/more-on-diet-and-dementia.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Emily Deans)</author><thr:total>7</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3045634714760830992.post-6338914248100004476</guid><pubDate>Sat, 31 Dec 2011 19:39:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2011-12-31T14:39:15.251-05:00</atom:updated><title>Ring in the New Year</title><description>Whew. &amp;nbsp;A bit of a hiatus there. &amp;nbsp;I hadn't quite realized how much I had overextended myself until decamping to Texas for some serious sitting around. &amp;nbsp;There I had all sorts of unrealized ambitious plans to read and get caught up, visit some local &lt;a href="http://www.crossfitaustin.com/"&gt;Crossfits&lt;/a&gt;, answer some emails, etc. &amp;nbsp;I did very little at all besides the holiday stuff, a handful of morning runs, and reading some fiction. &amp;nbsp;Since the whole family was recovering from a steady onslaught of viral preschool nastiness that began before Thanksgiving, I sorely needed the rest. &amp;nbsp;A very mild but persistent case of walking pneumonia had settled in, so it was nice to take it easy and finally get well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the midst of the sitting around, I was able to visit two Austin "real food" restaurants, &lt;a href="http://hudsonsonthebend.com/"&gt;Hudson's on the Bend&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;(where I had rattlesnake cakes - not gluten-free but very tasty, and Hudson's has several gluten-free options) and &lt;a href="http://fndaustin.com/new/"&gt;Foreign and Domestic&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;(steak and pigs brains. &amp;nbsp;I have to say the brains at &lt;a href="http://animalrestaurant.com/"&gt;Animal&lt;/a&gt; were better, but the steak at F&amp;amp;D was fabulous, the yogurt with dill sauce sublime, and the atmosphere quintessential Austin).&amp;nbsp; I'm told the &lt;a href="http://www.noblepigaustin.com/"&gt;Noble Pig&lt;/a&gt;

Sensibly.</title><description>&lt;br /&gt;There is a reason I stick to relatively easily modifiable practices and how they might (possibly!) improve health and prevent disease. &amp;nbsp;I like fun exercise, real food, wool socks in the wintertime, and sunshine. &amp;nbsp;I don't like to think about the years of farm pesticide waste seeping into the groundwater, or &lt;a href="http://chriskresser.com/category/toxins"&gt;the estrogenic compounds in plastic&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;Plastic compounds are ubiquitous and incredibly convenient. &amp;nbsp;In all our packaged foods. &amp;nbsp;Sippy cups. &amp;nbsp;Tupperware. &amp;nbsp;IV bags and tubing. &amp;nbsp;Coating paper receipts. &amp;nbsp;In the lining of canned foods and soda. &amp;nbsp;The most famous is BPA (found primarily in receipts and number 7 plastic), but all sorts of plastic contain all sorts of weird compounds. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-v2W-ePvMGJs/Tuud_NikHqI/AAAAAAAAAOs/CbuDB5bdgSM/s1600/4326238697_be8b3064b6.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="320" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-v2W-ePvMGJs/Tuud_NikHqI/AAAAAAAAAOs/CbuDB5bdgSM/s320/4326238697_be8b3064b6.jpg" width="220" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/intheozone/4326238697/sizes/m/in/photostream/"&gt;Image from Flickr Creative Commons&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;I like to live a relatively processed food and gluten free life - but philosophical ramblings about &lt;a href="http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/p-nu/201104/smoking-candy-cigarettes"&gt;candy cigarettes&lt;/a&gt; aside, I don't dive across the table and grab the birthday cake out of my kid's hand at the party. &amp;nbsp;(I'm not generally tempted by the birthday cake myself, as it is generally of the grocery-store azol-dye soybean oil frosted variety. &amp;nbsp;There was an incredible ice cream cake at a recent party that I'll admit to stealing a few bites from). &amp;nbsp; There's a line between living a somewhat normal life and being completely obsessed and anxiety-ridden about food, and I certainly don't want the kids to be obsessed and anxiety-ridden about food. &amp;nbsp; Nor would I lie about my kids having celiac or peanut allergies - the last thing I want is a terrified preschool teacher calling me about the goldfish cracker my kid snatched from some other kid's lunch, and should she call an ambulance or what. &amp;nbsp;Nothing is totally off-limits within reason, though the healthy stuff has to be consumed first, before the leftover Halloween candy. &amp;nbsp;And yes, they do get gluten-free pretzels as a snack (they are cooked in palm oil). &amp;nbsp;And sometimes those sugar-bombs otherwise known as &lt;i&gt;raisins&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So we muddle through, minimizing harm, and the way I approach plastics is to slowly transition away from them and avoid heating anything (or putting hot food) in them. &amp;nbsp;(I try not to think about those years and years of microwaved lean cuisines). &amp;nbsp;I get milk delivered from a local organic dairy in glass bottles. &amp;nbsp;Is that enough? &amp;nbsp;Some (many of you, perhaps) would say no. &amp;nbsp;But aluminum lunch containers are expensive (and have plastic lids that tend not to fit as closely as plastic on plastic), and many of the plastic ones I have are still serviceable and attractive. &amp;nbsp;Canned foods are also tricky - on a mostly "paleo" "real foods" "avoiding processed food" diet the major canned foods will be coconut milk and tomato products (maybe canned pumpkin?). &amp;nbsp;In general I made an effort to avoid these except for maybe once per week, figuring, again, the dose makes the poison, and tomato sauce makes anything more palatable for the kids (a variation of the old parenting trick of putting ketchup on everything.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ignorance is bliss, really. &amp;nbsp;At the end of November a research letter was published in JAMA- "&lt;a href="http://jama.ama-assn.org/content/306/20/2218.2.short"&gt;Canned Soup Consumption and Urinary Bisphenol A: A Randomized Crossover Trial&lt;/a&gt;." In this little Harvard School of Public Health Study, student and staff volunteers consumed 12 ounces of either fresh (prepared without canned ingredients) or canned (Progresso brand) soup daily for lunch (they were vegetarian varieties of course - this is HSPH!). &amp;nbsp;For the first 5 day period, the soup was consumed daily. &amp;nbsp;After a 2-day washout, the treatment assignments were reversed. &amp;nbsp;Urine samples were taken on the 4th and 5th days of each phase. &amp;nbsp;Urinary BPA was found in 100% of Progresso consumers and 77% of fresh soup consumers, and following the 5 days of canned soup, urinary BPA was 1221% higher than the urinary BPA of the fresh soup consumers. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;"The increase in urinary BPA concentrations following canned soup consumption is likely a transient peak of uncertain duration. &amp;nbsp;The effect of such intermittent elevations in urinary BPA concentration is unknown. &amp;nbsp;The absolute urinary BPA concentrations observed following canned soup consumption are among the most extreme reported in a nonoccupational setting."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to admit I'd canned (heh heh) Progresso and other pre-prepared soups from my eating list a long time ago due to the biochemistry-happy omega-6 fest in the list of ingredients… as expected from any processed food maker trying to scratch a profit by using the least expensive commodity items. &amp;nbsp;I try to use marinara sauce from a glass jar whenever possible (we'll ignore the plastic seal around the top), and I'm looking for good convenient alternatives to canned coconut milk… but the pantry still has some canned items, to be sure. &amp;nbsp;And certainly the &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/More-Than-Gourmet-Culinary-32-Ounce/dp/B001PNXO5Y/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1324068884&amp;amp;sr=8-2"&gt;cardboard box variety&lt;/a&gt; of foods has plastic in the lining as well, right? &amp;nbsp;I make more and more of my own bone broth, but sometimes you just need a bit of stock on hand. &amp;nbsp;Am I being hopelessly neurotic and silly worrying about plastics, BPA, and canned items (and handling receipts as little as possible)?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, 2011 has not been a friendly year for BPA. &amp;nbsp;A month before the research letter in JAMA alarmed the Progresso soup executives, another scary article was published in &lt;i&gt;Pediatrics: &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href="http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/128/5/873"&gt;Impact of Early-Life Bisphenol A Exposure and Executive Function in Children&lt;/a&gt; (free full text!). &amp;nbsp;A prospective observational study, so the typical caveats apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Urine was collected from pregnant women at 16 and 26 weeks, and at birth) and later from the resultant babies at 1, 2, and 3 years of age. &amp;nbsp;The results? &amp;nbsp;Well, BPA was detected in &amp;gt;97% of the gestational and child urine samples. &amp;nbsp;With adjustment for confounders, each 10-fold increase in &lt;i&gt;gestational&lt;/i&gt; BPA concentrations was associated with more anxious and depressed behavior on standardized scales, along with poorer emotional control. &amp;nbsp;This was true more of girl babies than of boys. &amp;nbsp;The urinary levels in the children themselves didn't make much difference in behavior, and there was no difference between girls and boys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was another scary article about exposure of infants to breastfeeding moms replete with BPA that I can't find now, and&lt;a href="http://jama.ama-assn.org/content/305/1/28.2.extract"&gt; this cute article&lt;/a&gt; from January in JAMA about nematodes and BPA. &amp;nbsp;I avoid gluten (for the most part) due to some skin effects and general creepiness, and I don't see why I should feel differently about estrogenic compounds leaching from plastics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But no, I don't leap across the table and grab the Capri Sun out of my kid's hand at the birthday party either. &amp;nbsp;Nor will I add a machete to my list of standard kitchen tools so that I can make coconut milk from scratch. &amp;nbsp; I drink from a plastic-free water container at the gym and the next set of lunchbox containers will be metal… but life has to be lived. &amp;nbsp;And at least I can worry about these things affecting my children, rather than tuberculosis, mines, or revolution. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3045634714760830992-6129142631416893772?l=evolutionarypsychiatry.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>http://evolutionarypsychiatry.blogspot.com/2011/12/time-to-freak-out-sensibly.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Emily Deans)</author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-v2W-ePvMGJs/Tuud_NikHqI/AAAAAAAAAOs/CbuDB5bdgSM/s72-c/4326238697_be8b3064b6.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>30</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3045634714760830992.post-6249747985956416783</guid><pubDate>Sat, 10 Dec 2011 22:39:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2011-12-12T19:35:06.396-05:00</atom:updated><title>Evolution and Anorexia Nervosa</title><description>There was a bit of a &lt;a href="http://carbsanitychronicles.blogspot.com/2010/09/how-gary-taubes-would-treat-anorexia.html"&gt;dust-up&lt;/a&gt; in the paleo and low carb blogosphere about some comments Gary Taubes apparently made about anorexia and insulin in an interview. &amp;nbsp;He noted that insulin was used as a &lt;a href="http://journals.lww.com/smajournalonline/Citation/1946/05000/Anorexia_Nervosa_With_Special_Regard_To_Insulin.10.aspx"&gt;therapy for anorexia&lt;/a&gt;, thus suggesting that (perhaps) anorexia, like obesity, is a disorder of fat metabolism. My suspicion is that Gary was using those studies as an example of how insulin could cause weight gain. &amp;nbsp; On the other hand, one doesn't need exogenous insulin to refeed anorexics &amp;nbsp;- the time-tested method is to keep those far gone enough to have medically dangerous symptoms (unstable blood pressure, dropping electrolytes, or super slow heart rate) under lock and key and get calories in whatever way possible (including via a tube inserted into the stomach.) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of my attendings in at Children's Hospital characterized anorexia as "a desperate disease." &amp;nbsp;Often purging and starvation are combined (though this combination would be more correctly called "eating disorder not otherwise specified" or "anorexia nervosa, bingeing-purging subtype" than strict anorexia nervosa), and there were many cases of young teenagers hiding vomit and stool in places in their rooms to conceal purging and to get laxatives (not surprisingly, constipation is a symptom of anorexia). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d1jzT24E8Q&amp;amp;feature=artist"&gt;Cowboy Junkies - Bea's Song (one of the better songs ever written - right click to open in new tab)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My evolutionary psychiatry interest has always been in how psychiatric disorders have changed over the past 100 years of rapidly changing lifestyle and diet. &amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://evolutionarypsychiatry.blogspot.com/2010/08/history-of-eating-disorders.html"&gt;Anorexia nervosa is one of those illnesses that was exceedingly rare until 50 years ago&lt;/a&gt;, then escalated rapidly, then leveled off so far as prevalence, though those who are affected encompass more children and more men now than ever before. &amp;nbsp;My educated guess is that only a small percentage of us are capable of starving ourselves outright without being under lock and key, and that vulnerable population shows symptoms earlier and earlier in life as societal pressures and the obesogenic environment increases. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A quote from my previous blog post linked above (the medical literature references can be found there):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #110000; font-family: Arial, Tahoma, Helvetica, FreeSans, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px;"&gt;All eating disorders remain relatively rare [though in total they are more common than schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder]. Anorexia afflicts about 0.5% of women and 0.1% of men. Bulimia around 1-3% of women (also 0.1% of men), and binge eating disorder 3.3% of women and 0.8% of men&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #110000; font-family: Arial, Tahoma, Helvetica, FreeSans, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px;"&gt;. Anorexia nervosa remains the most deadly of all psychiatric disorders&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #110000; font-family: Arial, Tahoma, Helvetica, FreeSans, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px;"&gt;, with a 5-10% death rate within 10 years of developing the symptoms, and an 18-20% death rate within 20 years. Anorexia is endemic in the fashion industry, to the point where models are &lt;a href="http://main.stylelist.com/2010/05/17/healthy-magazine-airbrush-skinny-model-adds-weight/"&gt;now being airbrushed to add curves&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #110000;

In the hospital, &lt;a href="http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/evolutionary-psychiatry/201103/dieting-can-make-you-lose-your-mind"&gt;patients work closely with dietitians&lt;/a&gt;, trying to learn how to eat a healthy amount and to establish a better relationship with food. &amp;nbsp;While medicines that promote weight gain are prescribed, antidepressants and other agents are fairly useless in a starvation situation. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can imagine the typical well-meaning dietician designed diets for these sick young people. &amp;nbsp;It's the food pyramid with way too many grains, too little fat, and a focus on "healthy" rather than good old fashioned farm fresh food. &amp;nbsp;And while I don't really have any objections a food pyramid Mediterranean-style whole foods diet (autoimmune issues with grains notwithstanding), I know that what happens in real life is not skipping breakfast, a light lunch, and a late supper of mussels, olive oil, roasted peppers, tapenade and homemade sourdough bread, but rather three meals and two snacks a day, a version of Weight Watchers™ with Skinny Cow ice cream sandwiches, whole grain Rice o Roni, cans of beans, omega-6 laden commercial salad dressing, boneless skinless chicken breasts, &amp;nbsp;and "lite" yogurt. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem with so many meals a day is that one has to think about food constantly. &amp;nbsp;I don't think that is the best way to recover from an eating disorder, though one would have to be careful with fasting as well. &amp;nbsp;I believe intermittent fasting is a valuable practice, a way to lower food reward and to ultimately establish a good relationship with food - I don't have to have it right now, but later would probably be fine too - however, fasting can trigger binges in those who are vulnerable. &amp;nbsp;It is not verboten in those of normal or excess weight, but should be undertaken with care and support. &amp;nbsp;In my mind, the healthiest diet is one that you don't have to think about all that much - poached eggs, a beef stew with some liver chunks you cook once and eat all week long. &amp;nbsp;Cold potatoes and butter. &amp;nbsp;Forgetting to eat every now and again. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dX3k_QDnzHE"&gt;M83 &amp;nbsp;Midnight City (right click to open in new tab)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe &lt;a href="http://thatpaleoguy.com/"&gt;Jamie&lt;/a&gt; sent me this recent paper, &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20838399"&gt;Role of the evolutionarily conserved starvation response in anorexia nervosa&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;It is a fascinating piece, with an in-depth consideration of biology, evolution, and insulin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The authors speculate that "AN [anorexia nervosa] may be caused by defects in the evolutionarily conserved response to food and nutrient shortage associated with reduced calorie intake."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some more facts about eating disorders - in 10-20% of patients, the disorder is short-lived. &amp;nbsp;In 20-30% it is chronic and unremitting. &amp;nbsp;The most seriously affected are at greatest risk for hypothyroidism, loss of bone density, electrolyte disturbances, low blood cell counts, amenorrhea, suicide, and death. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In anorexia, the physiology of starvation is paramount. &amp;nbsp;Both brain and peripheral metabolism responses come into play, orchestrated by the brain and the endocrine system (I don't think obesity is far different - I see no reason that obesity would be regulated by fat tissue or the liver when the brain and endocrine system are doing their thing). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The goal of the starvation response is to conserve energy, delay growth, preserve ATP (by increasing efficiency of energy metabolism) and to minimize oxidative damage. &amp;nbsp;In starvation, changes in the hypothalamus of the brainstem result in a fall in blood insulin levels and a suppression of other anorexogenic factors. &amp;nbsp;Once ketosis occurs with the depletion of glycogen stores, there is an increase in output from the sympathetic nervous system and stimulation of food-seeking behaviors. &amp;nbsp;These multiple pathways explain why fasting can be healthy, but also stressful. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the major biochemical pathways activated is the &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v464/n7288/fig_tab/nature08980_F1.html"&gt;IGF-1/FOXO&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v464/n7288/fig_tab/nature08980_F1.html"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;response (an insulin growth factor 1 pathway). &amp;nbsp;So the authors of this paper postulate something a bit similar to Gary Taubes - anorexia arises when there is defective regulation in the starvation pathway, similar to how insulin deficiency (due to insulin resistance) is a factor in diabetes. &amp;nbsp;Meaning there is a lot going on with respect to home life, environment, stress, and temperament in eating disorders, but only a select few have the genetic capability to deliberately starve themselves is response to the environment, and those few may have differences in the IGF-1/FOXO pathway. &amp;nbsp;The researchers were able to find some yeast, fruit flies, worms, and mice with defects in that pathway who tend to restrict food and develop more slowly (or, alternatively, eat more and spontaneously gain weight), and who have genetic differences in the IGF-1/FOXO pathway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Evidence for genetic vulnerability to anorexia includes the fact that eating disorders are highly heritable. (Uruguayan model &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luisel_Ramos"&gt;Luisel Ramos and her sister &lt;/a&gt;both died from anorexia in recent years). &amp;nbsp; When doing genome-wide linkage analysis of families with eating disorders, many components of the starvation response pathway are located in highly suspect genetic areas. &amp;nbsp;In practical terms, the increased impetus on thinness and subsequent dieting brings out the reinforcing starvation response as a result of the genetic vulnerability. &amp;nbsp;A single episode of excessive caloric restriction seems to bring out long-term changes in the neurotransmitter production mediated by FOXO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;Thus caloric restriction and weight loss predispose to additional episodes of dieting, especially in susceptible individuals wih defective regulation of their starvation response, or with perseverative bias in behavior, reflected in obsessive thoughts and compulsivity.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How do these general ideas affect treatment? &amp;nbsp;Family therapy, distress tolerance, and cognitive behavioral therapy around distorted body image is a cornerstone of therapy for eating disorders, along with the refeeding. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Should we use insulin to treat anorexia? &amp;nbsp;Well, the reactive hypoglycemia and other risks are problematic. &amp;nbsp;A more sophisticated approach is to use IGF-1 itself - it can increase appetite and reverse bone loss seen in anorexia. &amp;nbsp;Long term treatment tends to result in hyperplasia of the lymphatic tissue, tumor promotion, and excess accumulation of body fat. &amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Better that we never begin dieting in the first place. &amp;nbsp;Skipping the processed foods and ensuring there are plenty of healthy fat and nutrients for the brain and muscles seems like the optimal and common sensical approach in that regard. &amp;nbsp;I'm not sure what to do about the fashion industry...&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3045634714760830992-6249747985956416783?l=evolutionarypsychiatry.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>http://evolutionarypsychiatry.blogspot.com/2011/12/evolution-and-anorexia-nervosa.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Emily Deans)</author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Y-6ocKC6REY/TuUoV9kR7lI/AAAAAAAAAOk/RoSx1xfqC_E/s72-c/Isabelle_Caro.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>18</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3045634714760830992.post-7966207823967227069</guid><pubDate>Sat, 03 Dec 2011 21:18:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2011-12-03T19:06:16.418-05:00</atom:updated><title>Beyond the Chemical Imbalance Part 2</title><description>Love the new song from the new album by the Black Keys: &amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uD64ruAb8vs"&gt;Lonely Boy (from El Camino)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's all this talk about pathogenesis, chickens, and eggs. &amp;nbsp;Well, I know where it ends. &amp;nbsp;We chase the trail back to the beginnings (is it abuse? &amp;nbsp;temperament? &lt;a href="http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/evolutionary-psychiatry/201105/could-soda-and-sugar-be-causing-your-depression"&gt;soda&lt;/a&gt;? &amp;nbsp;ho-hos? &amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/evolutionary-psychiatry/201107/the-science-good-nights-sleep"&gt;winter&lt;/a&gt;? &lt;a href="http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/evolutionary-psychiatry/201103/your-brain-omega-3"&gt;rancid vegetable oil&lt;/a&gt;? &amp;nbsp;bad reality TV? &amp;nbsp;the jury is still out).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But here is where it ends. &amp;nbsp;Ground zero. &amp;nbsp;Ratty neurons, smoking mitochondria, and brain damage. &amp;nbsp;Inflammation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;Inflammation is the term for the complex biological response of tissues to harmful stimuli, such as pathogens, damages cells, or irritants. &amp;nbsp;Inflammation is a protective attempt by the organism to remove the injurious stimuli as well as initiate the healing process for the tissue.&lt;/blockquote&gt;I knew there was a reason I liked this paper so much. &amp;nbsp;Two sentences of real wisdom. &amp;nbsp; The paper continues on to talk about cell death, mitochondria, and the cell "executioners" called capases. &amp;nbsp;They are cysteine proteases that bring it when a cell needs offing. &amp;nbsp;These are the cellular equivalent of the Necro-whatevers from &lt;a href="http://www.thechroniclesofriddick.com/"&gt;Chronicles of Riddick&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Overproduction of reactive oxygen species by shoddy, inefficiently-acting mitochondria is a central feature of neuron cell death. &amp;nbsp; The tricky wicket is that mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death leads to more inflammation, dysfunction, and cell death. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;The presence of an inflammatory response in major depression… is evidenced by, amongst other things, increased plasma levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and acute phase reactants, oxidative damage to red blood cell membranes and serum phospholipids, and lowered serum zinc.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Pro-inflammatory cytokines can &lt;i&gt;induce&lt;/i&gt; depression in 70% of people treated with such agents. &amp;nbsp;Elevations of cytokines have been reported in depression, anxiety, fibromyalgia, migraines, IBS, chronic fatigue syndrome, diabetes, autoimmune arthritis… of course, says any doctor. &amp;nbsp;The so-called "mitochondrial cocktail" can improve mitochondrial function after a few months and includes the following: &amp;nbsp;CoQ10, riboflavin, and at least one additional antioxidant (vit C, E, or alpha lipoic acid), and l-carnitine or creatine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Older school psychopharmacologists will try the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tricyclic antidepressants - they act as classical mitochondrial decouplers by hindering ATP synthesis and enhance ATPase activity. &amp;nbsp;They tend to change how mitochondria function in a neuroprotective way. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SSRIs: some seem to be toxic to mitochondria at large doses, but protective at lower doses. &amp;nbsp;In animal models, all antidepressants attenuate inflammation-induced brain cytokine production and prevent the development of depression induced by high dose interferon. &amp;nbsp;In fact, antidepressants seem to have this effect regardless of mechanism (SSRI, tricyclic, lithium) - which is a major argument against the monoamine theory of depression. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lithium: seems to enhance mitochondrial function in humans and rats. &amp;nbsp;Long-term is even better than short-term. &amp;nbsp;Lithium is the favored medicine of the gray-haired psychopharmacologist. &amp;nbsp;Between the neuroprotective effects and the anti-suicide benefit, you might expect people to encourage&lt;a href="http://evolutionarypsychiatry.blogspot.com/2011/02/lithium-and-longevity.html"&gt; lithium to be in the water&lt;/a&gt;…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shock therapy: &amp;nbsp;Yes, it is still around. &amp;nbsp;Frankly, there is no faster treatment for depression and it works in refractory cases, thus is often a lifesaver. &amp;nbsp;It has terrible side effects, there's no denying it. &amp;nbsp;And it seems to increase the mitochondrial efficiency in rats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Up to 50% of patients with major depression are unresponsive to medications… here is a poem from old Egyptian papyrus (from the anchor paper)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;Disease has sneaked into me. &amp;nbsp;I feel my limbs heavy. &amp;nbsp;I no longer know my own body. &amp;nbsp;Should the master physician come to me… My heart is not revived by his medicines.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3045634714760830992-7966207823967227069?l=evolutionarypsychiatry.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>http://evolutionarypsychiatry.blogspot.com/2011/12/beyond-chemical-imbalance-part-2.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Emily Deans)</author><thr:total>27</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3045634714760830992.post-1320594493771512032</guid><pubDate>Mon, 28 Nov 2011 20:59:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2011-11-28T19:21:00.820-05:00</atom:updated><title>Depression - Beyond the Chemical Imbalance (Part 1)</title><description>Today we go back to the basics of depression. &amp;nbsp;Borodin's Nocturne (&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqjLHbSy6Pg&amp;amp;feature=related"&gt;right click to open in new tab&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say there are three main theories held by the general public about the causes of depression:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Bootstrap theory: &amp;nbsp;you are a lazy good-for-nothing who just needs to snap out of it and get up and get yourself better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Trauma theory: too much stress, death, trauma, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) The chemical imbalance: &amp;nbsp;You have an SSRI deficiency and your serotonin needs to be regulated (&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vfSFXKlnO0"&gt;see this memorable old zoloft commercial&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, I don't subscribe to any of these theories entirely, though there are elements to each of them that hold a kernel of truth - my belief and one that is largely supported by the literature is that stress and genetic susceptibility leads to depressive symptoms, which are mediated by inflammatory means in the brain. &amp;nbsp;And certainly if one is capable, getting up and getting out and exercising and eating right can be very helpful, but sometimes asking a depressed person to wake up early and exercise is like asking someone with a broken ankle to go for a run. &amp;nbsp;The frontal lobe isn't firing on all cylinders. &amp;nbsp;There's no motivation, no zazz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scientifically minded probably are most familiar with theory number three. &amp;nbsp;In medical terms, the "chemical imbalance" theory is called the "monoamine hypothesis" of depression. &amp;nbsp;The monoamine theory is (I would say) largely accepted by doctors of a certain age (even psychiatrists), but it holds about as much water as the carbohydrate-insulin theory of obesity. &amp;nbsp;Back in the day there was a medication for blood pressure called &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserpine"&gt;reserpine&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;Among other things it depletes the brain of serotonin, and does indeed tend to cause depression (it is rarely used nowadays). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first antidepressant, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isoniazid"&gt;a drug used to treat tuberculosis&lt;/a&gt;, was found &lt;a href="http://www.cpnhelp.org/wow_inh_both_a_antidepres"&gt;serendipitously&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;One of its actions was to change the concentrations of monoamines (such as serotonin and norepinephrine) in the synapse between nerves. &amp;nbsp; And thus, the monoamine hypothesis of depression was born along with a billion dollar antidepressant industry. &amp;nbsp;All the antidepressants affect the monoamines one way or another, and they work… if you are lucky, often with side effects, and maybe they protect your brain during one episode of depression, but they don't seem to protect you from the next episode if you go off the medicine when you feel better (talk therapy when compared to medicines seems to have more long term benefit, not surprisingly).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Along the way, the monoamine theory picked up a bunch of other diseases (called the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affective_spectrum"&gt;affective spectrum disorders&lt;/a&gt;) including major depressive disorder's anxious twin, generalized anxiety disorder, migraines, irritable bowel syndrome, bipolar disorders, social phobia, PTSD, OCD fibromyalgia, and chronic fatigue syndrome among others (&lt;a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278584610002964"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;). &amp;nbsp;All of these diseases have been shown to respond (somewhat) to three or more different classes of antidepressant medication.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Problem is, when you measure serotonin in depressed people, the levels are often all over the map. &amp;nbsp;In fact, low serotonin doesn't really correlate with depression very well at all, though low serotonin in the central nervous system does correlate with suicide, violence, and insomnia. &amp;nbsp; Brain researchers quickly figured out that the monoamine hypothesis has some pretty big holes, and the mechanism of antidepressants is not about increasing serotonin and other monoamines in the synapse but rather changing the efficiency with which monoamine signals are transmitted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead, the current literature-supported theory of the brain pathology of depression and the other affective spectrum disorders leads us to two things going awry - the immune system (inflammation) and mitochondrial dysfunction. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How messy is the study of depression? &amp;nbsp;Consider these facts - if we look at the modern criteria, the classic unipolar major depression is a smallish subset of the whole. &amp;nbsp;31-62% of people with depression have symptoms of "atypical depression" (leaden feelings in the arms and legs, increased appetite, increased sleep, as opposed to the classic weight loss and insomnia). &amp;nbsp;64-72% of those with atypical depression meet criteria for bipolar spectrum disorders. &amp;nbsp;Depressive disorders are often comorbid with ADHD, anxiety, and substance abuse disorders. &amp;nbsp;You can see if we try to study a group of patients with "major depressive disorder" by criteria that represents the typical clinical outpatient, we will get a mix of people with various complicating neuropsych problems, and any studies of so-called "pure" major depressive disorders where other problems are excluded (which is typical for pharmaceutical studies) will not necessarily be generalizable to the actual population.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Add in frequent comorbid medical conditions, and you have a whole soup of pathology. &amp;nbsp;92% of depressed inpatients have pain, typically headaches or muscle aches. &amp;nbsp;Irritable bowel and migraines are often found, along with metabolic syndrome, pre-diabetes and diabetes, and obesity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, rather than be taken aback by the complexities, theories of mitochondrial dysfunction and inflammation can scoop up the entire variable pathology (which makes these theories very pleasing to me). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So let's start with &lt;a href="http://evolutionarypsychiatry.blogspot.com/2011/02/basic-science-energy-is-everything.html"&gt;mitochondria&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;As we know, these are the energy factories of the cells, and their primary mission is to make the cellular equivalent of gasoline, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenosine_triphosphate"&gt;ATP&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;Problems with the mitochondria tend to show up as symptoms with the most energetically hungry cells of the muscle and nerves. &amp;nbsp; Nutritionally, CoQ10, carnitine, B-vitamin, and selenium deficiencies can also cause mitochondrial dysfunction directly. &amp;nbsp;Mitochondria desperately need these micronutrients to do their work efficiently. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Symptoms of mitochondrial dysfunction can be non-specific, but the cognitive symptoms are very similar to those found in depression, including impairments in attention and &lt;a href="http://www.ncld.org/ld-basics/ld-aamp-executive-functioning/basic-ef-facts/what-is-executive-function"&gt;executive function&lt;/a&gt; and memory. &amp;nbsp;Tellingly, in families with known genetic problems with mitochondria, the symptoms worsen around times of stress - overwork, fasting, over-exercise, and environmental temperature extremes. &amp;nbsp;Children with mitochondrial disorders are more likely to be depressed than control children, and among adults, folks with known mitochondrial disorders are more likely to have depression, chronic fatigue, major depressive disorders, bipolar disorder, and panic disorder than the general population. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But all of that is the typical chicken and egg clinical stuff. &amp;nbsp;Maybe people with genetic mitochondrial problems have a lot of stress, and are thus more depressed. &amp;nbsp;What's the biochemical evidence for mitochondrial dysfunction in major depressive disorders (and bipolar disorder)? &amp;nbsp;Autopsies show all sorts of interesting problems with mitochondrial proteins, unusual mitochondrial DNA mutations, and poor mitochondrial complex activity (&lt;a href="http://archpsyc.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/67/4/360"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;). &amp;nbsp;ATP production rates and respiratory chain enzyme ratios seem to be decreased in the muscle of biopsied patients with major depressive disorder and pain. &amp;nbsp;In fact, several studies have shown that patients with a high degree of somatic complaints (typically muscle aches) have much lower ATP production than average in the muscle. &amp;nbsp;In chronic fatigue patients, some similar abnormalities have been found. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And finally, in some mouse models of mitochondrial dysfunction, the mice have bipolar-like symptoms and altered levels and turnover of the monoamines. &amp;nbsp;The researchers worked out that the mitochondrial dysfunction was the cause of the monoamine depletion, leading to the mouse mood disorders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So mitochondrial problems (which can be brought about genetically, but also by micronutrient deficiencies) can cause oxidative stress, and eventually lead to nerve damage and psychiatric symptoms. &amp;nbsp;More on the specifics of this pathology and the role of inflammation in the next post.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3045634714760830992-1320594493771512032?l=evolutionarypsychiatry.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>http://evolutionarypsychiatry.blogspot.com/2011/11/depression-beyond-chemical-imbalance.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Emily Deans)</author><thr:total>16</thr:total></item></channel></rss>
